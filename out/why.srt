1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:10,949
That woman, single super woman, single Wonder Woman, single, I get it now, I'm single because I'm a superhero.

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:20,819
I'm single, because I'm a superhero superhero. The reason why you're still single is not because you're a superhero.

3
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,769
It's because you don't know how to treat a man.

4
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:35,309
And at the end of the day, that is the simple explanation for why any female over the age of 30 is still single,...

5
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:42,780
is because she doesn't know how to give men what they want.

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,400
Okay, a woman who is feminine, a woman who is respectful, a woman who will admire him, a woman who will have his back,...

7
00:00:51,090 --> 00:01:00,090
not a woman who's going to constantly be trying to stab him in the back, a woman who is constantly trying to pull the rug out from underneath him,...

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,560
a woman who is going to be hostile towards him, a woman who is going to constantly compete with him. No, no guy wants that.

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:18,120
And that is what too many modern women today all have in common, is they have way too much ego. And they are trying to compete with their own men.

10
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:34,170
But I love this, this viral Tick Tock meme that's going around and you have all of these much older females over the age of 30, who are just glomming on to this and doing their own version of it, like,...

11
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,040
Look, the reason I'm single, because I'm a bad person. It's not because I treat my boyfriend horribly.

12
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,790
It's not cuz I cheat on him or I go to happy hour after work,

13
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,850
and I don't come home or go clubbing with my girlfriends on the weekend and lie to him about it. It's not because of those reasons.

14
00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:01,170
It's cuz I'm a superhero. I'm bad woman. I'm Wonder Woman. I'm Catwoman, horrible, bad girl.

15
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,810
No, the reason why you're still single is because you just don't know how to treat your man. Okay?

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:19,680
And whenever you're with a guy, and you don't give him what he needs as a man, he will eventually lose interest in you,...

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,800
no matter how hot you are, no matter how fine you are.

18
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:30,000
And that's why we have so many of these older females, these former hobbies that I constantly talk about on this channel,...

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,280
who are still single, well into their middle ages and beyond.

20
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:44,850
And Funny enough, the the woman who created this kind of viral Tick Tock meme to begin with,...

21
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:53,190
this woman must have been closing in on 60 if not older, okay. She had gray hair, she looked like a grandmother.

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,770
She must have been at least 60 or older.

23
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,440
And she was sitting here saying the reason I'm still single, the reason I'm not married, I don't have a husband. I don't have grandkids.

24
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:18,210
I just me and my cat. The reason for this, I figured it out. I'm Wonder Woman. I'm bad woman. I'm Superwoman. No. Okay.

25
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:26,010
The reason is, is because you never gave a man what he needed from you. That is why you're still single.

26
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:40,290
Because no man wants to be with a modern woman who is going to constantly compete with him constantly lash out at him constantly back backtalk him constantly tried to take the lead from him.

27
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:49,830
No man wants that. Okay, why? Because you're, you're pretty much stealing. Right?

28
00:03:49,830 --> 00:04:01,830
You're practically stealing his ability to be a man in the relationship to function in that relationship. And dating modern woman these days.

29
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,480
You know, at least these types of women who are glomming on to this little viral meme like a superhero for being single.

30
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:19,230
Now, those type of women are generally the type of women that most men are repelled by right.

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,280
Most men just beyond sex, we will not stay with a woman like that, sure, we'll stick around for sex.

32
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:41,160
But if you have nothing to offer us beyond sex, other than a pretty face and a loud mouth. We rather just cut our losses and be gone. Right?

33
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,230
We are not going to stick around for that.

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,190
And this is why you see women who are even just average looking but very feminine, able to hang on to their man.

35
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:57,900
Right, their marriages last forever and ever because they give their man what they need. Right? They let their man take the lead.

36
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,910
They let their man feel like a man in their life. Should ship, they don't constantly try to compete with him.

37
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:14,129
Okay, and they're able to enjoy their relationships because when you let your man be the man, it allows you to be the woman.

38
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,759
When you allow your man to be masculine, it allows you to be feminine.

39
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:24,900
But when you have two parties getting together, and they're both trying to be masculine, doesn't work doesn't work.

40
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:32,940
And it's especially frustrating when the other person who's supposed to be feminine is acting masculine too. We're just like, we're done.

41
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:40,170
Okay, we're done. I don't need this. I don't need this drama from you, because there are other women out there and I rather just move on to them.

42
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,680
And if they're going to pull this Superwoman bat woman, I'm Catwoman. You know, I'm Supergirl, all this other shit.

43
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,550
We're going to, you know, and it's usually after sex. Usually, the guy will stick around long enough to have sex with you, then he will ghost you.

44
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,640
And this is why so many modern women today are being ghosted. They're being ghosted after sex, and they're complaining about it.

45
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:06,000
And it's like, instead of looking in the mirror and going, what am I doing wrong, that I can fix?

46
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,840
So these guys that I really like that I have sex with, okay,...

47
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,450
that I invest my body into, and risk getting pregnant and carrying a child for nine months.

48
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,940
These guys that I'm, I'm spending time with, how do I keep these guys around instead of like,...

49
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:35,160
try to be a little introspective, and look at yourself and try to figure out what's going wrong. What do these girls do? Nope. No, no agency here?

50
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:42,390
No, I'm not gonna accept responsibility for my wrongdoings. Nope. The reason I'm single is because I'm a superhero.

51
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,480
What kind of message is that sending? Hollywood, right? What kind of message is that sending.

52
00:06:48,480 --> 00:07:01,830
And the funny thing too, if you really think about this, these superhero characters that these older single women are glomming on to as the reason for why they're still single Wonder Woman,...

53
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:14,250
bad woman, super woman. What do all three of these women have in common? What all three of these women have in common? is they're not real. Okay?

54
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:28,320
They are fictional characters in a fictional fantasy. Okay, and a movie that was created by the main stream, right that was created by the matrix.

55
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:38,340
Hollywood. Right. And what does Hollywood want to do to young impressionable ladies? They want them to be independent, strong and a power.

56
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:48,210
I don't need a man. You can do it on your own. Feminism is a great idea. Chase at corporate career, you don't need a man. Any good man who's worth?

57
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,700
Who's worth anything.

58
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:58,080
We'll be there waiting for you, girl, when you're 30 when you're 40 when your corporate career is all settled, if he's a good man, he'll be there.

59
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:07,770
And then these women buy into that crap, right. And then one day they wake up, they're 30 or 40. Where's my guy? Where's my forever, man? Oh, snap.

60
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,950
He's nowhere to be found. Because I thought I was Wonder Woman. I thought I was Superwoman. I thought I was batwoman. Hmm.

61
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,270
I thought I was superhero for being single. No, you're just the fool. You're just an idiot.

62
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:28,170
Okay, you're an idiot, who did not think for yourself who did not take accountability for your actions. And didn't try to fix yourself. Okay?

63
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:40,650
The only reason why you're still single, and you can hang on to a man is because of you. Okay? It's not because you're a superhero.

64
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:49,050
It's because of you. Take responsibility for that. take accountability for that so you can fix it. They just like me back in the day, right?

65
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,890
I was phenomenal. And pickup still am. Right. But back in the day, I was trying to wife my girlfriend's right as my blue pill.

66
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:03,030
Think I was trying to wife my girlfriends. And even though I was phenomenal at picking up new women, I couldn't hang on to them.

67
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:09,540
I would get into relationships. I get jealous. I get like, oh possessive sometimes, like why do you have to go out with your girlfriend?

68
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,170
Where are you going? and blah, you know, I mean, I was mate guarding. I was doing all that blue pill nonsense. And I kept losing the girl.

69
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:25,140
At no point did I go Hey, man. The reason why these girls just keep taking off is because I'm Bruce Wayne. Right? Bruce Wayne is planning women.

70
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,440
Bruce Wayne, Batman. Oh, I'm Tony Stark, Iron Man. That's why they just leave. No, I didn't do that shit. Because that's cowardly.

71
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,730
Instead, I looked in the mirror and I said, Look, you bastard. What do we need to do to fix this? Why do these girls just keep taking off?

72
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,130
And that is when I started to go beyond just game and pick up and I'm like, Okay,...

73
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,170
how if I want to I want I mean, I want to have the option to keep these girls like I met some cool girls.

74
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,400
I lose them what's going on? I need to look at me. What am I doing wrong? And that's what I figured out.

75
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:05,310
I'm like, oh, that may guarding the simplest behavior. living your life around the girl. You know, I mean all the things I teach you guys, right?

76
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:14,250
But you don't come to these realizations and become a better person until you're able to look inside of yourself.

77
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:34,380
But if you keep blame shifting and looking for excuses, and glomming on to these ridiculous means that are relieving you of accountability for your poor actions for your bad behavior, you're never going to learn and you're just going to stay single, you're just going to now, not now, you're not just the 30 year old,...

78
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,590
single female with cats, you're the 40 year old, single female and cat, then you'll be the 50 year old, single female with cats.

79
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:48,330
And then you'll be like the lady who originally created his tic Tock video, you'll be the 60 year old female living alone with cats,...

80
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,860
because you never tried to fix the core of what is wrong.

81
00:10:52,950 --> 00:11:05,460
And the funny thing is, I saw so many older and pretty decent looking older women glom on to this and do their own version of it, because I guess that's what you do on Tick Tock you like,...

82
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,770
take the original audio, and then you lip sync it. That's just completely silly.

83
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:17,490
To me, I mean, that it just, it just, it just completely, like juveniles, not something I would do.

84
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,280
But I see a lot of these chicks in their 30s 40s and 50s.

85
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:31,020
doing that, right, that are still single, and it's like, you know, you're not a bad looking chick, why are you still single? That's the reason why.

86
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,690
Because you have not looked inside yourself to fix what the problem is.

87
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:44,400
And usually the problem is exactly what I said in the very beginning of this coaching video, you don't know how to give men what they want.

88
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,900
Men want a feminine woman who respects them, who admires them, who has their back, who is supportive.

89
00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:01,560
And it's not constantly trying to challenge him for the lead in that relationship is not constantly trying to sabotage that relationship, or,...

90
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,040
or be hostile towards them all the time.

91
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:12,030
I mean, that stuff is mentally draining, physically draining, emotionally draining whenever you fail to just act like a woman.

92
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,300
And it just gets to the point where another chick comes along, and we're like, see, Elena,...

93
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:28,650
and even if no chick comes along, we're still like, see you later. ratebeer rather be alone. Right?

94
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:42,330
But it's hilarious to me how these so many of these young single women were glomming on to this little viral Tiktok video and using this as an excuse for why they're still single.

95
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:49,830
And I wouldn't even be surprised if like my ex from 2006 probably glommed on to this, I've still single tickets or two different fathers,...

96
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,950
because I'm super women, bat woman's Wonder Woman. That's why I'm still single. It's like, no bitch.

97
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,860
The reason why you're still single, is because you're a horrible person, and you don't know how to treat your man. That's why you're still single.

98
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,380
Right? And for many of these girls, that's why they're single, right? Just admit that to yourself.

99
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,990
So you can fix that like, hey, maybe I'm a terrible person. Maybe I don't know how to treat my man.

100
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:21,150
Maybe I shouldn't be cheating on him or trying to constantly replace him. 24 seven, maybe I should shut up once in a while.

101
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:30,510
Maybe I shouldn't argue with him. 24 seven. Maybe when he comes home from work, instead of ignoring him and not having any meal ready for him?

102
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:36,930
Maybe I should like give him a backrub without even asking for maybe I should do something for him.

103
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Right But so many of these modern women today mee mee mee mee mee mee their favorite to favorite note,

104
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:53,670
but that is the reason why you're still single fat because you're a superhero. It's because you don't know how to treat your man.

105
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,920
And could be also because you're terrible person. Right? fix that.

106
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,530
Take some accountability, stop trying to look for reasons and means for why you're still single.

107
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:15,750
Okay, because the answer to why you're still single is staring you right in the mirror. Okay, it's staring you right in the mirror.

108
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:25,650
And only you can fix that. So, as always guys, drop your comments below. Let me know what you think of today's coaching video.

111
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,020
That's why they're the dg it's because I'll it's not because I'm dg it's because I'm a superhero.

112
00:14:49,290 --> 00:15:00,000
That is the most insane arguments for why you don't have a man why you can't hang on to a man. It's just wow, just wow. Leave your comment.
