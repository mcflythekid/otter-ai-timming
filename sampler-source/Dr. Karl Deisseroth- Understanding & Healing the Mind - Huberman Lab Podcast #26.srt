00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:27,960
the

1487
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,290
time.

1488
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:28,620
So

1489
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,640
this

1490
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,660
is a

1491
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,020
lot

1492
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,110
of

1493
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,010
neuroscientists,

1494
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,340
and a

1495
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:32,490
lot

1496
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:32,730
of

1497
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,300
brain

1498
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:33,810
clinicians

1499
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,110
actually

1500
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,350
think

1501
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,680
these

1502
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:34,920
two

1503
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,160
should

1504
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,490
be

1505
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,580
the

1506
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,910
same

1507
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,390
field.

1508
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,080
At

1509
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,260
some

1510
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,560
point

1511
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:37,620
in

1512
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:37,680
the

1513
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,130
future.

1514
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:38,370
They

1515
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:38,550
were

1516
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,670
in

1517
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:38,730
the

1518
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,180
past,

1519
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,330
they

1520
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:39,690
started

1521
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,140
together.

1522
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,940
psychiatry,

1523
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,630
though,

1524
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,770
focuses

1525
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:43,920
on

1526
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,340
disorders

1527
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:44,460
where

1528
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,550
we

1529
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,940
can't

1530
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,230
see

1531
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,710
something

1532
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,860
that's

1533
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,250
physically

1534
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,610
wrong,

1535
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:47,820
where

1536
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:47,940
we

1537
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,150
don't

1538
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,390
have

1539
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:48,450
a

1540
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,020
measurable,

1541
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,260
there's

1542
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,500
no

1543
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,860
blood

1544
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,460
test

1545
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,030
that

1546
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,300
makes

1547
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,390
the

1548
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,290
diagnosis.

1549
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,650
There's

1550
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:52,830
no

1551
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,130
brain

1552
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,520
scan

1553
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:53,640
that

1554
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:53,940
tells

1555
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,210
us

1556
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,450
this

1557
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:54,570
is

1558
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,170
schizophrenia.

1559
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,380
This

1560
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,470
is

1561
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,040
depression

1562
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,310
for

1563
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,430
an

1564
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,850
individual

1565
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,360
patient.

1566
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:58,950
So

1567
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,580
psychiatry

1568
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,330
is is

1569
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,630
much

1570
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,290
more

1571
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,040
mysterious.

1572
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,670
And

1573
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,540
the

1574
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:03,810
only

1575
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,080
tools

1576
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,200
we

1577
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,500
have

1578
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:04,740
are

1579
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,340
words,

1580
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,450
neurologists

1581
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,050
are

1582
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,100
fantastic

1583
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,790
physicians,

1584
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,270
they

1585
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,990
see

1586
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:10,560
the

1587
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,010
stroke

1588
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,220
on

1589
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:11,490
brain

1590
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,150
scans,

1591
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,390
they

1592
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:12,930
see

1593
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,020
the

1594
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,710
seizure,

1595
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,280
and

1596
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,370
the

1597
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:14,610

1599
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,600
activity

1600
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,750
with

1601
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,840
an

1602
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,530
ECG.

1603
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,090
And

1604
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,300
they

1605
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,450
can

1606
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,200
measure

1607
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:19,770
and

1608
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,310
treat

1609
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,090
based

1610
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:21,210
on

1611
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:21,420
those

1612
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,990
measurables.

1613
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:22,710
in

1614
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,490
psychiatry,

1615
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:23,670
we

1616
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,790
have

1617
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,850
a

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,090
harder

1619
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:24,390
job.

1620
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,480
I

1621
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:24,870
think

1622
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,410
we

1623
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,070
use

1624
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,640
words.

1625
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,390
We

1626
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:27,570
have

1627
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:27,930
rating

1628
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,440
scales

1629
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,560
for

1630
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,130
symptoms,

1631
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,220
we

1632
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,400
can

1633
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,700
measure

1634
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,420
depression

1635
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,540
and

1636
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,110
autism

1637
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,290
with

1638
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:31,590

1639
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,920
scales,

1640
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,040
but

1641
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,250
those

1642
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:32,490
are

1643
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,030
words

1644
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,540
still.

1645
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,590
And

1646
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,040
ultimately,

1647
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,640
that's

1648
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:35,940
what

1649
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,480
psychiatry

1650
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:36,540
is

1651
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:36,810
built

1652
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,170
around.

1653
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,590
It's,

1654
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,040
it's

1655
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,160
an

1656
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,460
odd

1657
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,090
situation

1658
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,480
because

1659
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:39,660
we've

1660
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,050
got

1661
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:40,620
the

1662
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,040
most

1663
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,060
complex,

1664
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,110
beautiful,

1665
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,070
mysterious,

1666
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,900
incredibly

1667
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,620
engineered

1668
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,670
object

1669
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,760
in

1670
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:47,820
the

1671
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,300
universe.

1672
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,510
And

1673
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:48,690
yet

1674
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:48,810
all

1675
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:48,930
we

1676
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,320
have

1677
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,560
are

1678
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,040
words

1679
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,310
to

1680
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,730
find

1681
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:50,850
our

1682
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,060
way

1683
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,240
in.

1684
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:52,799
So do

1685
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:52,919
you

1686
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,249
find

1687
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:53,369
that

1688
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:53,579
if a

1689
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:54,269
patient

1690
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,379
is

1691
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:55,889
very

1692
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:56,369
verbal

1693
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:56,519

1702
00:09:58,769 --> 00:09:59,459
diagnosing

1703
00:09:59,459 --> 00:09:59,759
them

1704
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:00,269
As

or

1714
00:10:03,989 --> 00:10:04,439
it's,

1715
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:04,709
I

1716
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:04,829
could

1717
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:05,129
imagine

well.

1725
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,199
Well,

1726
00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:07,379
it

1727
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:07,829
because

1728
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,919
we

1729
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,129
only

1730
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:08,279

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:08,579
words,

1732
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:08,759
you

00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:08,939
put

1734
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:09,029
your

point,

1739
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:10,949
if

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:11,069
they

1741
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:11,249
don't

1742
00:10:11,249 --> 00:10:11,519

1743
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:11,669

1744
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:12,119
much,

00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:12,239
in

principle,

1747
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,109
it's

1748
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:13,589
harder.

1749
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,189
The

1753
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:15,029

that

00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:58,559
meaning

00:10:59,219 --> 00:10:59,519
there's

00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:06,029
psychiatrist?

1903
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah,

1904
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,810
this

1905
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,140
happens

1906
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,380
all

1907
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,440
the

1908
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,890
time.

1909
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,730
Parkinson's

1910
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,090
disease

1911
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,270
is a

1912
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,540
great

1913
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,170
example.

1914
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,400
It's,

1915
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,790
it's,

1916
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,360
it

1917
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,480
can

1918
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,840
be

1919
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,040
debilitating

1920
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,460
in so

1921
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:14,670
many

1922
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,270
ways

1923
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,780
people

1924
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:15,930
have

1925
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,230
trouble

1926
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,830
moving,

1927
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:16,950
have

1928
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,250
trouble

1929
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:17,910
walking,

1930
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,330
trouble

1931
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,020
swallowing,

1932
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,220
and

1933
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,700
they

1934
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,030
can

1935
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,450
have

1936
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,550
truly

1937
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,060
severe

1938
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,660
depression.

1939
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,350
And

1940
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,500
this

1941
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,740
is

1942
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,010
you

1943
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,220
might

1944
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,550
say,

1945
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,760
Oh,

1946
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:26,970
well,

1947
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,150
they've

1948
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,720
got a

1949
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,440
life

1950
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,130
threatening

1951
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,820
illness.

1952
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,600
But

1953
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,750
there

1954
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:30,810
are

1955
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,140
plenty

1956
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,230
of

1957
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:31,890
neurological

1958
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,370
disorders

1959
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,760
where

1960
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,330
depression

1961
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,450
is

1962
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,960
not a

1963
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,440
strong,

1964
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,400
strongly

1965
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,090
comorbid

1966
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,990
symptom,

1967
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:37,920
like

1968
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,460
ALS,

1969
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,610
Lou

1970
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:38,940
Gehrig's

1971
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,300
disease,

1972
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:39,450
for

1973
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:39,930
example,

1974
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,500
depression

1975
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:40,590
is

1976
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:40,800
not

1977
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,070
as

1978
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,520
strong,

1979
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,600
strongly

1980
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,080
comorbid

1981
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,170
in

1982
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:43,320
that

1983
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,680
disease.

1984
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,160
But

1985
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,250
in

1986
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,850
Parkinson's,

1987
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,090
it is

1988
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,870
extremely

1989
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,260
common.

1990
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,310
And

1991
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,610
as

1992
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:47,700
you

1993
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:47,970
know,

1994
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,390
in

1995
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,930
Parkinson's

1996
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,380
disease,

1997
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,500
we

1998
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:49,770
have

1999
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,220
loss

2000
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,340
of

2001
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:50,460
the

2002
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,940
dopamine

2003
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,420
neurons

2004
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,570
in

2005
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:51,840
the

2006
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,080
in

2007
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,290
the

2008
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,560
in

2009
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:52,680
the

2010
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,310
midbrain.

2011
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:53,910
And

2012
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:54,030
this

2013
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:54,240
is a

2014
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,960
very,

2015
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,340
you

2016
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,460
know,

2017
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,030
specific

2018
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,570
population

2019
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:57,660
of

2020
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,020
cells

2021
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,200
that's

2022
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,740
dying.

2023
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,100
And

2024
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,790
probably

2025
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,090
that

2026
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:00,420
leads

2027
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:00,570
to

2028
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:00,870
both

2029
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,960
the

2030
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,290

2031
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:01,890
disorder

2032
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,760
and

2033
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,090
the

2034
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,660
depression.

2035
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,200
There

2036
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,230
are

2037
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,410
many

2038
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:04,860
examples

2039
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:04,950
of

2040
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,160
that,

2041
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,310
where

2042
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:05,520
these

2043
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:05,670
two

2044
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,120
fields

2045
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,330
come

2046
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:06,840
together.

2047
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,260
And

2048
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,010
he

2049
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:08,220
really

2050
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,430
needs

2051
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:08,670
work

2052
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:08,880
as a

2053
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,240
team,

2054
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,360
I've

2055
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:09,540
had

2056
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:09,960
patients

2057
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,170
in my

2058
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:10,680
clinic,

2059
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,520
that

2060
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,120
I I

2061
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,390
treat

2062
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:12,480
the

2063
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,080
depression

2064
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,650
associated

2065
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:13,770
with

2066
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:13,890
their

2067
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,580
Parkinson's

2068
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,790
and a

2069
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,540
neurologist

2070
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:15,930
treats

2071
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,050
the

2072
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,560
movement

2073
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,100
associated

2074
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,190
with

2075
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,250
the

2076
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:17,910
Parkinson's,

2077
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,480
and

2078
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,570
we

2079
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:18,780
work

2080
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,260
together,

2081
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:19,860
do

2082
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:19,920
you

2083
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,160
think

2084
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,370
will

2085
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:20,520
you

2086
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:20,760
will

2087
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,030
ever

2088
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,270
have

2089
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,330
a

2090
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:21,750
blood

2091
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,200
test

2092
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,500
for

2093
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,130
depression

2094
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,220
or

2095
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:23,970
schizophrenia

2096
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,090
or

2097
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,720
autism?

2098
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,080
And

2099
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,620
would

2100
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,800
that

2101
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,040
be a

2102
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,370
good

2103
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,940
or a

2104
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,480
bad

2105
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:27,870
thing?

2106
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:29,699
I

2107
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:30,059
think

2108
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:30,749
ultimately,

2109
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:30,899
there

2110
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,079
will

2111
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:31,199
be

2112
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:31,739
quantitative

2113
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:32,279
tests.

2114
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:33,899
Already,

2115
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:34,289
efforts

2116
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:34,379
are

2117
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:34,589
being

2118
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:34,889
made

2119
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:35,039
to

2120
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,219
look

2121
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:35,429
at

2122
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:35,759
certain

2123
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,209
rhythms

2124
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:36,299
in

2125
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:36,359
the

2126
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:36,719
brain

2127
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,139
using

2128
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:37,739
external

2129
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:38,039
e

2130
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,609
G's,

2131
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:38,909
to

2132
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:39,059
look

2133
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,179
at

2134
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:39,839
brainwaves

2135
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,469
effectively,

2136
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:41,099
look

2137
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:41,219
at

2138
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:41,309
the

2139
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:41,939
ratios

2140
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:42,239
of

2141
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:42,689
certain

2142
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:43,439
frequencies

2143
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:43,559
to

2144
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:43,739
other

2145
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:44,459
frequencies.

2146
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,299
And

2147
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:45,449
there's

2148
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:45,629
some

2149
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:46,019
progress

2150
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:46,199
being

2151
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:46,409
made

2152
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:46,529
on

2153
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:46,709
that

2154
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:47,099
front,

2155
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:47,639
it's

2156
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:47,819
not

2157
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:47,909
as

2158
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:48,149
good

2159
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:48,449
as it

2160
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,959
could

2161
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,289
be,

2162
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:49,379
it

2163
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:49,679
doesn't

2164
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:50,219
really

2165
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:50,429
give

2166
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:50,489
you

2167
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:50,579
the

2168
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:51,119
confidence

2169
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:51,329
for

2170
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:51,449
the

2171
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:51,929
individual

2172
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:52,409
patient

2173
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:52,559
that

2174
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:52,679
you

2175
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:52,859
would

2176
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,039
you

2177
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,159
would

2178
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,549
like,

2179
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:54,629
but

2180
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:55,319
ultimately,

2181
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:55,529
what's

2182
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:55,799
going

2183
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,069
on in

2184
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,129
the

2185
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:56,399
brain

2186
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:56,729
in

2187
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,479
psychiatric

2188
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:58,439
diseases

2189
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,099
physical,

2190
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,299
and

2191
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:00,749
it's

2192
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:00,989
due

2193
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:01,169
to

2194
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:01,319
the

2195
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:01,859
circuits

2196
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:02,009
and

2197
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:02,069
the

2198
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,669
connections

2199
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:02,789
and

2200
00:13:02,789 --> 00:13:02,849
the

2201
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:03,419
projections

2202
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:03,509
in

2203
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,569
the

2204
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:03,839
brain

2205
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:03,959
that

2206
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:04,259
are

2207
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:05,069
not

2208
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:05,459
working

2209
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:05,609
as

2210
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:05,729
they

2211
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:05,939
would

2212
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:06,119
in a

2213
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:06,659
typical

2214
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:07,319
situation.

2215
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,689
And I

2216
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:09,839
do

2217
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,079
think

2218
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:10,199
we'll

2219
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:10,559
have

2220
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:10,859
those

2221
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,399
measurables

2222
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:11,489
at

2223
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:11,669
some

2224
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:12,029
point.

2225
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:12,689
Now,

2226
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:12,899
is

2227
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:13,139
that

2228
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:13,499
good

2229
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:13,589
or

2230
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:13,919
bad?

2231
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:14,369
You

2232
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:14,489
know,

2233
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:14,759
I

2234
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:14,999
think

2235
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:15,119
that

2236
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:15,239
will

2237
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:15,509
be

2238
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:15,899
good.

2239
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:15,989
And

2240
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:16,169
one

2241
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:16,229
of

2242
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:16,679
the

2243
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:17,279
challenges

2244
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,399
we

2245
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:17,789
have

2246
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:18,299
with

2247
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,379
psychiatry

2248
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,369
as it

2249
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:20,789
is an

2250
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:21,029
art

2251
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:21,179
as

2252
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:21,299
well

2253
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:21,479
as a

2254
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:21,959
science

2255
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,169
to

2256
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:22,709
elicit

2257
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,639
these

2258
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,019
symptoms,

2259
00:13:25,229 --> 00:13:25,439
in a

2260
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:25,919
precise

2261
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:26,339
way

2262
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,879
does

2263
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,149
take

2264
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:27,329
some

2265
00:13:27,329 --> 00:13:27,779
time.

2266
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:28,799
And

2267
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:28,859
it

2268
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:28,979
would

2269
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:29,069
be

2270
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:29,339
great

2271
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:29,579
if we

2272
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:29,699
could

2273
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:29,939
just

2274
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:30,089
do a

2275
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:30,329
quick

2276
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:30,869
measurement.

2277
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:32,099
Could

2278
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:32,519
it be

2279
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:33,179
abused

2280
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,139
or

2281
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:34,859
misused?

2282
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,639
Certainly.

2283
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:35,789
But

2284
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,029
that's,

2285
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:36,119
I

2286
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:36,299
think,

2287
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:36,539
true

2288
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:36,689
for

2289
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:36,839
all

2290
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:36,929
of

2291
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:37,439
medicine.

2292
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:38,490
I

2293
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:38,730
want

2294
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:38,790
to

2295
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,240
know,

2296
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,450
and

2297
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:39,540
I'm

2298
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:39,690
sure

2299
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:39,840
there

2300
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:39,900
are

2301
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,320
several

2302
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,770
but

2303
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,160
what

2304
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,220
do

2305
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,370
you

2306
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:41,610
see

2307
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:41,760
as

2308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:41,850
the

2309
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,180
biggest

2310
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,690
challenge

2311
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,350
facing

2312
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,370
psychiatry

2313
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:44,670
and

2314
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:44,760
the

2315
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,180
treatment

2316
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,390
of

2317

2318
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,590
illness?

2319
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,340
Today?

2320
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,380
I

2321
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,620
think

2322
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:49,740
we

2323
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,340
have,

2324
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:51,599
we're

2325
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:51,839
making

2326
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,319
progress

2327
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:52,439
on

2328
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:52,709
what

2329
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:52,889
the

2330
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:53,189
biggest

2331
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,639
challenge

2332
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:53,909
is,

2333
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:54,239
which

2334
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:54,329
I

2335
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:54,569
think

2336
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:54,749
there's

2337
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:54,989
still

2338
00:13:54,989 --> 00:13:55,199
such

2339
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,259
a

2340
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:55,739
strong

2341
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:56,249
stigma

2342
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:56,579
for

00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,179
psychiatric

2344
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:57,659
disease

2345
00:13:57,659 --> 00:13:57,959
that

2346
00:13:58,499 --> 00:13:59,339
patients

2347
00:13:59,369 --> 00:13:59,699
often

2348
00:13:59,699 --> 00:13:59,939
don't

2349
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,149
come

2350
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:00,269
to

2351
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:00,719
us.

2352
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:01,949
And

2353
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:04,289
they

2354
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:04,829
feel

2355
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:04,949
that

2356
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:05,069
they

2357
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:05,369
should

2358
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:05,489
be

2359
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:05,669
able

2360
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:06,029
to

2361
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:06,479
handle

2362
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:06,659

And

2367
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:09,569
that

2368
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:09,719
that

2369
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:09,899
can

2370
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:10,139
slow

00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:06,359
to

2526
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:06,719
talk

2527
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:06,989
about

2528
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,469
feelings.

2529
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:07,559
I

2530
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:07,679
mean,

2531
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:07,829
there's

2532
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,919
so

2533
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:08,129
many

2534
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:08,789
words,

2535
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,179
I

2536
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:09,419
don't

2537
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:09,509
know

2538
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:09,629
how

2539
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:10,019
many,

2540
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:10,259
but

2541
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:10,349
I'm

2542
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:10,589
guessing

2543
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:10,799
they're

2544
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:11,099
more

2545
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:11,279
than

2546
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,309
a

2547
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:11,579
dozen

2548
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:11,819
words

2549
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:11,909
to

2550
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:12,569
describe

2551
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:13,079
the

2552
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,529
state

2553
00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:13,679
that

2554
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:13,799
I

2555
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,039
call

2556
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,789
sadness.

2557
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:15,419
But

2558
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:15,569
as

2559
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:15,749
far

2560
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:15,929
as I

2561
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:16,319
understand,

2562
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:16,439
we

2563
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:16,589
don't

2564
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:16,679
have

2565
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:16,829
any

2566
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:16,979
way

2567
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:17,069
of

2568
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:17,519
comparing

2569
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:17,729
that

2570
00:15:17,729 --> 00:15:18,299
in a

2571
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,139
real

2572
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:19,619
objective

2573
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:19,949
sense.

2574
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,399
So

2575
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:20,849
how,

2576
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,119
as a

2577
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:21,779
psychiatrist

2578
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:21,989
when

2579
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:22,109
your

2580
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:22,409
job

2581
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:22,679
is to

2582
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:23,039
use

2583
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,489
words

2584
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:23,609
to

2585
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:24,449
diagnose

2586
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:25,199
words

2587
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:25,289
of

2588
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:25,379
the

2589
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:25,799
patient

2590
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:25,889
to

2591
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,519
diagnose,

2592
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:26,999
do

2593
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:27,509
you

2594
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,079
maneuver

2595
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:28,409
around

2596
00:15:28,409 --> 00:15:28,649
that?

2597
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,039
And

2598
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:29,399
what

2599
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:29,549
is

2600
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:29,699
this

2601
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:30,209
landscape

2602
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:30,329
that

2603
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:30,449
we

2604
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:30,779
call

2605
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:31,379
feelings

2606
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:31,499
or

2607
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:32,099
emotions?

2608
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:33,329
This

2609
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:33,689
is

2610
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:34,589
really

2611
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:35,309
interesting.

2612
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:36,479
People.

2613
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:37,169
Here

2614
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:37,289
we

2615
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:37,499
have

2616
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:37,619
it,

2617
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:37,859
there's

2618
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:37,889
a

2619
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:38,279
tension

2620
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:38,879
between

2621
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:39,029
the

2622
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:39,389
words

2623
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:39,509
that

2624
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,689
we've

2625
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:39,989
built

2626
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:40,319
up in

2627
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:40,379
the

2628
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:40,919
clinic,

2629
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,399
that

2630
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:41,699
mean

2631
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:42,209
something

2632
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:42,389
to

2633
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:42,629
the

2634
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:42,779
to

2635
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:42,869
the

2636
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:43,559
physicians,

2637
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:44,159
and

2638
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,249
then

2639
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:44,519
there's

2640
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:44,639
the

2641
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:45,449
colloquial

2642
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:45,689
use

2643
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:45,809
of

2644
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:46,169
words

2645
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:46,349
that

2646
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:46,499
may

2647
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:46,679
not

2648
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:46,799
be

2649
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:46,889
the

2650
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:47,249
same.

2651
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:47,399
And

2652
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:47,579
so

2653
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:47,849
that's

2654
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:47,939
the

2655
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:48,419
first

2656
00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:48,809
level

2657
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:48,899
we

2658
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:49,049
have

2659
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:49,139
to

2660
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,409
sort

2661
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:49,559
out

2662
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:49,739
when

2663
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:50,069
someone

2664
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,669
says,

2665
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:51,389
you

2666
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:51,629
know,

2667
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:52,049
I'm

2668
00:15:52,349 --> 00:15:53,399
depressed.

2669
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:53,789
What

2670
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,299
exactly

2671
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:54,449
do

2672
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:54,539
they

2673
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:54,809
mean

2674
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:54,959
by

2675
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,349
that?

2676
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:56,459
That

2677
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:56,579
may

2678
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:56,669
be

2679
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,059
different

2680
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:57,359
from

2681
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:57,719
from

2682
00:15:57,719 --> 00:15:57,839
what

2683
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:57,929
we're

2684
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:58,259
talking

2685
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:58,499
about

2686
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:58,589
in

2687
00:15:58,589 --> 00:15:58,859
terms

2688
00:15:58,859 --> 00:15:58,949
of

2689
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:59,429
depression.

2690
00:15:59,459 --> 00:15:59,639
So

2691
00:15:59,639 --> 00:15:59,909
part

2692
00:15:59,909 --> 00:15:59,999

2698
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:02,759
word,

2699
00:16:02,849 --> 00:16:03,089
and

2700
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:03,209

2704
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:04,499
they're

2705
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:04,919
actually

2706
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:05,339

jargon

2714
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:07,739
and

2715
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:08,279
get

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:08,399

they're

2724
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:11,129
So,

2725
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:12,209
you

2726
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:12,449
know,

00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:15,359
do

2734
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,419
you

2735
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:15,629
look

2736
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:15,959
forward

2737
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,139
into

2738
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:16,199
the

2739
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:16,649
future?

2740
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:16,829
How

2741
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:17,369
much

2742
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:18,629
hope

2743
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,719
do

2744
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:18,779
you

2745
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:18,989
have?

2746
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:19,079
How

2747
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:19,259
much

2748
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:19,799
planning

2749
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,949
are

2750
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:20,069
you

2751
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,309
doing

2752
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:20,459
for

2753
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:20,519
the

2754
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:20,969
future?

2755
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:21,209
So

2756
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:21,599
these

2757
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:21,929
here,

2758
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:22,079
now

2759
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:22,199
you're

2760
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:22,439
getting

2761
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:22,649
into

2762
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,369
actual

2763
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,239
things

2764
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:24,329
you

2765
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:24,479
can

2766
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:24,809
talk

2767
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:25,109
about

2768
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,259
that

2769
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:25,379
are

2770
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,369
unambiguous,

2771
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:26,759
someone

2772
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,089
says,

2773
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:27,299
Yeah,

2774
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:27,659
I

2775
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,019
can't

2776
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:28,379
even

2777
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:28,829
I

2778
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:29,099
can't

2779
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:29,249
even

2780
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:29,459
think

2781
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:29,729
about

2782
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:30,179
tomorrow,

2783
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:30,389
I

2784
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,159
don't

2785
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:32,279
see

2786
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:32,399
how

2787
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:32,519
I'm

2788
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:32,639
going

2789
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:32,699
to

2790
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:32,879
get

2791
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:32,999
to

2792
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:33,449
tomorrow.

2793
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,349
That

2794
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:34,799
that's

2795
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:34,859
a

2796
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:35,279
nice,

2797
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:35,819
precise

2798
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:36,119
thing

2799
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:36,359
that,

2800
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,539
you

2801
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:36,659
know,

2802
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:36,899
it's

2803
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:37,169
it's

2804
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:37,649
sad,

2805
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:37,769
it's

2806
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:38,279
tragic,

2807
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:38,489
but

2808
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:38,669
but

2809
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:38,789
it's

2810
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,389
also

2811
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:39,779
that

2812
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,079
means

2813
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,649
something.

2814
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:41,369
And

2815
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:41,459
we

2816
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:41,609
know

2817
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:41,729
what

2818
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:41,909
that

2819
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:42,209
means.

2820
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:42,449
That's

2821
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:42,539
the

2822
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:43,109
hopelessness

2823
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:43,499
symptom

2824
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:43,679
of

2825
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,249
depression.

2826
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:45,449
And,

2827
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,749
and

2828
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:46,019
that

2829
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:46,169
is

2830
00:16:46,169 --> 00:16:46,319
what

2831
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:46,619
I try

2832
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:46,709
to

2833
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:46,889
do.

2834
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:47,009
When

2835
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:47,219
I do

2836
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:47,249
a

2837
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:47,789
psychiatric

2838
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:48,119
interview,

2839
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:48,359
I try

2840
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:48,449
to

2841
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:48,629
get

2842
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,959
past

2843
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,049
the

2844
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:49,679
jargon,

2845
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:49,919
and

2846
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,099
get

2847
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:50,189
to

2848
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:50,369
what's

2849
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:50,699
actually

2850
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:51,089
happening

2851
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:51,149
in

2852
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:51,209
the

2853
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:51,659
patient's

2854
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:51,989
life

2855
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:52,319
and

2856
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:52,409
in

2857
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:52,529
their

2858
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:52,859
mind.

2859
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:53,519
But

2860
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:53,639
as

2861
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:53,729
you

2862
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:54,119
say,

2863
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:54,959
ultimately,

2864
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:55,379
you

2865
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:55,529
know,

2866
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:55,739
this

2867
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:56,069
shows

2868
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,369
up

2869
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:57,329
across,

2870
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,559
I

2871
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,759
address

2872
00:16:59,759 --> 00:16:59,939
this

2873
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:00,179
issue

2874
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:00,389
every

2875
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,569
day

2876
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:00,749
in my

2877
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:00,959
life,

2878
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,199
whether

2879
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:01,319
it's

2880
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:01,469
in a

2881
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:01,889
lab

2882
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,039
where

2883
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,279
we're

2884
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:02,999
looking

2885
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:03,239
at

2886
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:04,529
animals,

2887
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:05,219
whether

2888
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:05,669
fish,

2889
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:05,789
or

2890
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:06,179
mice,

2891
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:06,269
or

2892
00:17:06,269 --> 00:17:06,809
rats

2893
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:07,019
and

2894
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:07,949
studying

2895
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:08,099
their

2896
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,669
behavior,

2897
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:09,149
or

2898
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:09,359
when

2899
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:09,479
I'm

2900
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:10,439
in a

2901
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,159
conversation

2902
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:11,369
with

2903
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:11,699
just

2904
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:11,849
a

2905
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:12,239
friend

2906
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:12,359
or a

2907
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:12,929
colleague,

2908
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,309
or

2909
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:14,459
when

2910
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:14,579
I'm

2911
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:14,849
talking

2912
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:14,999
to a

2913
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:15,449
patient,

2914
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:15,899
I

2915
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:16,229
never

2916
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:16,499
really

2917
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:16,829
know

2918
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:17,129
what's

2919
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:17,399
going

2920
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:17,609
on

2921
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,149
inside

2922
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:18,329
the

2923
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:18,599
mind

2924
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:18,659
of

2925
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:18,749
the

2926
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:18,899
other

2927
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:19,409
person.

2928
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:20,819
I

2929
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,149
get,

2930
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:21,629
I get

2931
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:21,809
some

2932
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:22,349
feedback,

2933
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:22,739
I get

2934
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,249
words,

2935
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,239
I get

2936
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:24,899
behaviors,

2937
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:25,139
I get

2938
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:25,559
actions,

2939
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:25,769
but I

2940
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:26,069
never

2941
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,339
really

2942
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:26,609
know.

2943
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:27,539
And

2944
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:27,629
as

2945
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:27,719
you

2946
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:27,989
said,

2947
00:17:27,989 --> 00:17:28,079
at

2948
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,169
the

2949
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:28,349
very

2950
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:28,649
beginning

2951
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:28,769
of

2952
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:28,829
the

2953
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:29,399
question,

2954
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:29,609
you

2955
00:17:29,609 --> 00:17:29,729
know,

2956
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:30,029
often

2957
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:30,149
we

2958
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:30,449
don't

2959
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:30,749
even

2960
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:30,929
have

2961
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:31,019
the

2962
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,499
words

2963
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:31,649
and

2964
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:31,709
the

2965
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:32,219
insight

2966
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:32,609
to

2967
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:32,849
even

2968
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:33,299
understand

2969
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:33,419
what's

2970
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:33,689
going

2971
00:17:33,689 --> 00:17:33,959
on in

2972
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:34,109
our

2973
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:34,289
own

2974
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:34,589
mind.

2975
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:35,039
I

2976
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,189
think

2977
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:35,429
a lot

2978
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:35,519
of

2979
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,359
psychiatrists

2980
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:36,479
are

2981
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:36,749
pretty

2982
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:37,619
introspective.

2983
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:38,069
That's

2984
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:38,249
part

2985
00:17:38,249 --> 00:17:38,309
of

2986
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:38,369
the

2987
00:17:38,369 --> 00:17:38,669
reason

2988
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:38,759
they

2989
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:38,939
end

2990
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:39,239
up in

2991
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:39,449
that

2992
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,079
specialty.

2993
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:40,199
And

2994
00:17:40,199 --> 00:17:40,589
so

2995
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:41,969
maybe

2996
00:17:41,969 --> 00:17:42,359
we

2997
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,199
spend

2998
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:43,529
a

2999
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:43,709
little

3000
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:43,889
more

3001
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:44,159
time

3002
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:44,249
than

3003
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:44,339
the

3004
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:44,639
average

3005
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:45,029
person

3006
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,329
thinking

3007
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:45,539
about

3008
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:45,689
what's

3009
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:45,959
going

3010
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,169
on

3011
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:46,319
with

3012
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:46,559
him.

3013
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:46,829
But

3014
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:47,009
that

3015
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:47,219
doesn't

3016
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:47,399
mean

3017
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:47,489
we

3018
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:47,879
have

3019
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:48,629
answers.

3020
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,370
So in

3021
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,510
this

3022
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,590
area

3023
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:52,680
of

3024
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:52,920
trying

3025
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,040
to

3026
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,400
figure

3027
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:53,610
out

3028
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:53,790
what's

3029
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,030
going

3030
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,210
on

3031
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,420
under

3032
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:54,510
the

3033
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:54,840
hood,

3034
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,170
through

3035
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:55,650
words,

3036
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,190
sounds

3037
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,400
like

3038
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,910
certain

3039
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,540
words,

3040
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,470
would

3041
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,920
relate

3042
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,400
to

3043
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,910
this,

3044
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,600
this

3045
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,870
idea

3046
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,960
of

3047
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,710
anticipation

3048
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:01,830
and

3049
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,220
hope.

3050
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,270
Is it

3051
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,480
fair

3052
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,570
to

3053
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:03,780
say

3054
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:03,960
that

3055
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,200
that

3056
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,680
somehow

3057
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,160
relates

3058
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,280
to

3059
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,400
the

3060
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,880
dopamine

3061
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,360
system

3062
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,510
in

3063
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:06,570
the

3064
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:06,930
sense

3065
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,350
that

3066
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,340
dopamine

3067
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,490
is

3068
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:08,910
involved

3069
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,000
in

3070
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,510
motivated

3071
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,350
behaviors?

3072
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,560
I

3073
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,770
mean,

3074
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:10,980
is

3075
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,160
that

3076
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:11,880
if I

3077
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,120
say,

3078
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,300
for

3079
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,080
instance,

3080
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,590
and I

3081
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,860
won't

3082
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,100
ask

3083
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,190
you

3084
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,430
to

3085
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,790
run a

3086
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,300
session

3087
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,510
with

3088
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,660
me

3089
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:15,930
here,

3090
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:16,920
for

3091
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,310
free?

3092
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,000
We'll

3093
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,120
do

3094
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,270
that

3095
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,450
off

3096
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:18,750
camera

3097
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,140
guy,

3098
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,500
right?

3099
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,120
If I

3100
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,300
were

3101
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,360
to

3102
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:21,870
say,

3103
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,140
you

3104
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,290
know,

3105
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,070
I, I

3106
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,400
just

3107
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,880
can't

3108
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,930
imagine

3109
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,830
that

3110
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,880
tomorrow,

3111
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,030
I

3112
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,270
just,

3113
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,990
I

3114
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,200
just

3115
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,500
can't

3116
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:28,650
do

3117
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:28,830
it.

3118
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,100
So

3119
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,700
that's,

3120
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,210
that's

3121
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,420
not

3122
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,840
action

3123
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,110
based.

3124
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,290
That's

3125
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:31,680
purely

3126
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,010
based

3127
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,430
on my

3128
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,790
my

3129
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,270
internal

3130
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,750
narrative.

3131
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,100
But I

3132
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,280
could

3133
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:35,700
imagine

3134
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,030
things

3135
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,480
like,

3136
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:36,870
you

3137
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,200
know,

3138
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,040
I, I

3139
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,160
have

3140
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,190
a

3141
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,520
terrible

3142
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:38,730
time

3143
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,420
sleeping.

3144
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:39,870
I'm

3145
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,080
not

3146
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,620
hungry.

3147
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:40,740
I'm

3148
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:40,920
not

3149
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,190
eating.

3150
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,460
So it

3151
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,970
statements

3152
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:42,480
about

3153
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,020
physical

3154
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,500
actions,

3155
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm

3156
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,010
guessing

3157
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,340
also

3158
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:44,760
have

3159
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,260
validity?

3160
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:46,890
Absolutely.

3161
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,520
And

3162
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:47,760
there

3163
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:47,820
are

3164
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,030
now

3165
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,420
ways

3166
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,930
to

3167
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,040
measure

3168
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,550
the

3169
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,150
accuracy

3170
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,210
of

3171
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,420
those

3172
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,810
statements.

3173
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:51,960
Like

3174
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,110
for

3175
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,410
instance,

3176
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:52,590
if I

3177
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,770
gave

3178
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:52,890
you

3179
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,550
permission,

3180
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:53,940
you

3181
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,120
could

3182
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,450
know

3183
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:54,720
if I

3184
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,110
slept

3185
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,380
last

3186
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:55,770
night,

3187
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,010
or

3188
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,220
whether

3189
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:56,250
or

3190
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:56,490
not I

3191
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:56,610
was

3192
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:56,790
just

3193
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,090
saying

3194
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,360
I had

3195
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,420
a

3196
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,720
poor

3197
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:57,990
night's

3198
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,320
sleep.

3199
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,710
Yes.

3200
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,280
That's

3201
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,460
right.

3202
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,330
So in

3203
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,050
moving

3204
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,650
forward

3205
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:01,830
through

3206
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,730
2021,

3207
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:02,910
and

3208
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,090
into

3209
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:03,180
the

3210
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,480
next

3211
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,750
10

3212
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,870
and

3213
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,200
100

3214
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,470
years

3215
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,560
of

3216
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,340
psychiatry,

3217
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:05,880
do

3218
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,000
you

3219
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,450
think

3220
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:06,870
that

3221
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,380
the

3222
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:07,920
body

3223
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,760
reporting

3224
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,150
some

3225
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,330
of

3226
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:09,810
the

3227
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,010
actions

3228
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,190
of a

3229
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,700
human

3230
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,600
are

3231
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:12,810
going

3232
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:12,870
to

3233
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,440
become

3234
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,130
useful

3235
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:14,700
and

3236
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,180
met

3237
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:15,630
mesh

3238
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:15,810
with

3239
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:15,930
the

3240
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,530
words

3241
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:16,770
in a

3242
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:16,920
way

3243
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,130
that's

3244
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,250
going

3245
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:17,310
to

3246
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,460
make

3247
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:17,610
your

3248
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:17,910
job

3249
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,600
easier?

3250
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,260
I do

3251
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,500
think

3252
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:19,710
that's

3253
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:19,950
true.

3254
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,100
And

3255
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,400
these

3256
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,430
are

3257
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,610
the

3258
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:20,790
two

3259
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,060
things

3260
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,180
you

3261
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,690
mentioned

3262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,050
eating

3263
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,170
and

3264
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,590
sleeping.

3265
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:22,800
Those

3266
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,040
are

3267
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,730
additional

3268
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,320
criteria

3269
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,470
that

3270
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:25,560
we

3271
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:25,740
use

3272
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:25,860
to

3273
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,400
diagnose

3274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,880
depression.

3275
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,060
These

3276
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,150
are

3277
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,270
the

3278
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,900
vegetative

3279
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,230
signs,

3280
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,350
we

3281
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,530
call

3282
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:28,650
them

3283
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:28,740
with

3284
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,250
depression,

3285
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:29,490
poor

3286
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:29,850

3287
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:29,940
and

3288
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,150
poor

3289
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,480
eating.

3290
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,020
And

3291
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,080
if

3292
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,170
you

3293
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,290
have

3294
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,350
a

3295
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,860
baseline

3296
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:31,980
for

3297
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,460
somebody,

3298
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:32,700
that's

3299
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:32,790
the

3300
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,000
real

3301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,420
challenge,

3302
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:33,660
though,

3303
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,410
what's

3304
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:34,920
different

3305
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,010
in

3306
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:35,160
that

3307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,520
person,

3308
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:35,940
some

sleep

3314
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,680
more,

3315
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:37,950
some

3316
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,370

3317
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:38,580

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,210
they

3322
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,900
less.

3323
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:40,740
Some

3324
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:40,980

3325
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,100

depressed,

3328
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,000
they're

3329
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:42,300
more

3330
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:42,750

they

3334
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,250
move

3335
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:44,520
around

3336
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:44,880
more.

3337
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,180
Some

3338
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:45,390
people

3339
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:45,450

3345
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,160
even

And

3350
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:48,690
so

3351
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:48,810
you

3352
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,200
need

3353
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,320

3354
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,560
here's

3355
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:49,650
the

3356
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,130
challenge

3357
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,250
is

3358
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,520
you

3359
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:50,910
can't

3360
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,540
just

3361
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:51,840
look

3362
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,050
at

3363
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,260
how

3364
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,410
they

3365
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:52,590
are

3366
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,130
now

3367
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,340
you

3368
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:53,520
have

3369
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:53,640
to

3370
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,120
get a

3371
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,870
baseline

3372
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:55,890
and

3373
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,130
then

3374
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,310
see

3375
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,490
how

3376
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:56,640
it's

3377
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,240
changed.

3378
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,690
And

3379
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,110
that

3380
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,260
can

3381
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:58,410
be a

3382
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,830
challenge

3383
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,950
that

3384
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,580
raises

3385
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,390
You

3386
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,480
know,

3387
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,840
ethical

3388
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,590
issues?

3389
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,250
And

3390
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:02,370
how

3391
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,460
do

3392
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,640
you

3393
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:02,820
how

3394
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:02,880
do

3395
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:02,970
you

3396
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,480
collect

3397
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,720
that

3398
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,200
baseline

3399
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,710

someone

3402
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:05,400
healthy,

3403
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,460
I

3404
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,700
don't,

3405
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:05,850
I

3406
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,060
don't

3407
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,300
think

3408
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:06,750
that's

3409
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,170
something

3410
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,260
we

3411
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,500
have

3412
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:07,950
solved.

3413
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:08,700
Of

3414
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,240
course,

and

3420
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,520
phones,

3421
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,060
you

3422
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,300
could

3423
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,420
in

3424
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,960
principle

3425
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,350
collect

3426
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,680
a lot

3427
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:13,800
of

3428
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,280

3432
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,290
But

3433
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,530
that

3434
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:16,740
would

3435
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:16,860
have

3436
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,250
to be

3437
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,120

3442
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,090
reasons.

3443
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,750
And

3444
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,870
in

3445
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,140

00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,670
the

3563
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,090
inflection

3564
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:00,180
of

3565
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,300
their

3566
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,870
voice,

3567
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,260
or

3568
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:01,620
the

3569
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,100
speed

3570
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,190
at

3571
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:02,400
which

3572
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:02,490
they

3573
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:02,670
get

3574
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:02,790
up

3575
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,000
from

3576
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,060
a

3577
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,510
chair,

3578
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:03,690
do

3579
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:03,750
you

3580
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,960
think

3581
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,050
that

3582
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,320
those

3583
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:04,500
kind

3584
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:04,560
of

3585
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,950
metrics

3586
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,100
will

3587
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,520
eventually

3588
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:05,880
inform

3589
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,270
somebody?

3590
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,510
Hey,

3591
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:06,600
you

3592
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,810
know,

3593
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,290
you're

3594
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:07,380
in

3595
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,830
trouble.

3596
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,250
This

3597
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,370
is

3598
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:08,640
getting

3599
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:08,760
to

3600
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:08,910
this

3601
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,240
question

3602
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,420
of

3603
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,020
the

3604
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,410
back

3605
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:10,500
to

3606
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,590
the

3607
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:10,950
statement

3608
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:11,100
that

3609
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,220
I

3610
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,460
heard

3611
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:11,580
you

3612
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:11,850
make

3613
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,000
and

3614
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,270
wrong

3615
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,480
in my

3616
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:12,750
mind.

3617
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,020
Now,

3618
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,140
I

3619
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,350
think

3620
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,530
for

3621
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:13,740
more

3622
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:13,890
than

3623
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:13,950
a

3624
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,370
decade,

3625
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:14,580
which

3626
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:14,790
is,

3627
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,540
oftentimes

3628
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:15,690
we

3629
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:15,870
don't

3630
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,080
even

3631
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,260
know

3632
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,440
how

3633
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:16,620
we

3634
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:16,950
feel.

3635
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,190
Yeah,

3636
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:17,760
you

3637
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:17,880
know,

3638
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,180
that

3639
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:18,510
that

3640
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:18,780
I do

3641
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,050
like,

3642
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:19,350
because

3643
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,530
that

3644
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:19,890
gives

3645
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,010
the

3646
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,490
patient

3647
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:20,640
the

3648
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,240
agency

3649
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,540
to

3650
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,080
detect

3651
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,260
what's

3652
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,500
going

3653
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:22,710
on.

3654
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,400
And

3655
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:23,820
even

3656
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,150
separate

3657
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,300
from

3658
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:24,600
modern

3659
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,170
technology,

3660
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,350
this

3661
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:25,470
has

3662
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:25,650
been

3663
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:25,920
part

3664
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,040
of

3665
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,310
the

3666
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,490
the

3667
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:26,700
art

3668
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:26,760
of

3669
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,420

3670
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:27,840
is to

3671
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,260
help

3672
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:28,680
patients

3673
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,010
realize

3674
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:29,100
that

3675
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,460
sometimes

3676
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,670
other

3677
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,240
people

3678
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,200
observing

3679
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,620
them,

3680
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,520
can

3681
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,760
give

3682
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,000
them

3683
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,090
the

3684
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,660
earliest

3685
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:33,960
warning

3686
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,410
signs

3687
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,500
of

3688
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:34,980
depression,

3689
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,070
we

3690
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,250
see

3691
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:35,400
this

3692
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,670
very

3693
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,000
often

3694
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,780
and

3695
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,410
family,

3696
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:37,860
they'll

3697
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,130
they'll

3698
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,610
notice

3699
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:38,850
when

3700
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:38,940
the

3701
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,360
patient

3702
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,510
is

3703
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,110
changing

3704
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,800
before

3705
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:40,890
the

3706
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,280
patient

3707
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,580
does.

3708
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,270
And

3709
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,600
then

3710
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,810
there

3711
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:42,840
are

3712
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,080
things

3713
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,170
the

3714
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,440
patient

3715
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,560
may

3716
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,890
notice,

3717
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,010
but

3718
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,340
not

3719
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:44,910
correctly

3720
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,450
ascribed

3721
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,050
to

3722
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,500
the

3723
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:46,860
onset

3724
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:46,920
of

3725
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,490
depression.

3726
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:47,730
And a

3727
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,180
classic

3728
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,540
example

3729
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:48,600
of

3730
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:48,810
that

3731
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,020
is

3732
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,140
what

3733
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,230
we

3734
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:49,470
call

3735
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:49,770
early

3736
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,160
morning

3737
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:50,790
awakening.

3738
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,390
And

3739
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:51,540
this

3740
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:51,630
is

3741
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:51,960
something

3742
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,050
that

3743
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,320
can

3744
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,650
happen

3745
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,070
very

3746
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:53,490
early,

3747
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:53,640
as

3748
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:53,880
people

3749
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,180
start

3750
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,270
to

3751
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,600
slide

3752
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:54,810
into

3753
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,260
depression,

3754
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,320
they

3755
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,590
start

3756
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,680
to

3757
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:55,950
wake

3758
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,070
up

3759
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,460
earlier

3760
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,550
and

3761
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,120
earlier,

3762
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:57,570
you

3763
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:57,750
know,

3764
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,140
just

3765
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,130
inexplicably,

3766
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,340
they're

3767
00:21:59,340 --> 00:21:59,670
awake.

3768
00:21:59,700 --> 00:21:59,940
This

3769
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,030
is

3770
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,210
like

3771
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,380
2am 3am,

3772
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,070
awaken,

3773
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,250
it

3774
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,400
could

3775
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:02,820
start

3776
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,060
Yeah,

3777
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,210
could

3778
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:03,510
start

3779
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,600
at

3780
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,260
5am

3781
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,410
could

3782
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:04,620
go to

3783
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,370
four

3784
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,640
and

3785
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,090
unable

3786
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:06,150
to

3787
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,390
fall

3788
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,600
back

3789
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:06,930
asleep.

3790
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,020
And

3791
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,080
they

3792
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,230
both

3793
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,350
fall

3794
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,530
back

3795
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:07,890
asleep.

3796
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,490
Exactly.

3797
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,060
So

3798
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,510
that's

3799
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,750
and

3800
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,110
that

3801
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,350
they

3802
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:10,500
may

3803
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:10,890
not

3804
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,730
know

3805
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:11,850
what

3806
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,120
to do

3807
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,210
with

3808
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,390
that

3809
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,480
it

3810
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,630
could

3811
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:12,780
just

3812
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:12,990
be

3813
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,500
from

3814
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:13,650
their

3815
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,130
perspective

3816
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,190
is

3817
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,340
just

3818
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,640
something

3819
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:14,760
that's

3820
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,210
happening.

3821
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:16,050
But

3822
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,140
if

3823
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,200
you

3824
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,380
put

3825
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,620
enough

3826
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:16,680
of

3827
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:16,830
that

3828
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,580
information

3829
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,120
together,

3830
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,510
that

3831
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:18,810
that

3832
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:18,990
could

3833
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,140
be a

3834
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,500
useful

3835
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,770
warning

3836
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,130
sign

3837
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:20,280
for

3838
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,370
the

3839
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:20,790
patient,

3840
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:20,880
and

3841
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:20,970
it

3842
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,090
could

3843
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,240
help

3844
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,360
them

3845
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,600
seek

3846
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:21,960
treatment.

3847
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,140
And I

3848
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,380
think

3849
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:22,560
that

3850
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:22,740
is

3851
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,340
something

3852
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,520
that

3853
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,700
could

3854
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:23,820
be

3855
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,120
really

3856
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,600
valuable.

3857
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,470
Interesting.

3858
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,690
So in

3859
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:28,620
this

3860
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,220
framework

3861
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,490
of

3862
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,640
you

3863
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:29,760
know,

3864
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,210
needing

3865
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,690
words

3866
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,020
to

3867
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,470
self

3868
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:31,920
report

3869
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,010
or

3870
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,520
machines

3871
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:32,640
to

3872
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,240
detect

3873
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,570
how

3874
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:33,720
we

3875
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,080
feel

3876
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,410
or

3877
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:34,680
and

3878
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,010
maybe

3879
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,160
in

3880
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,430
form

3881
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,640
of

3882
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,960
psychiatrist,

3883
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:37,650
how a

3884
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,010
patient

3885
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,340
feels

3886
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,090
want

3887
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,270
to

3888
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,170
touch

3889
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,560
on

3890
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,190
some

3891
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,310
of

3892
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,430
the

3893
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,150
technologies

3894
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,300
that

3895
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:42,420
you've

3896
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,540
been

3897
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:42,870

building.

3900
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,550
But

3901
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,360
as a

3902
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:45,720
way

3903
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:45,840
to

3904
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,140

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,440
into

3906
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,860
that.

3907
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,330
Are

3908
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,570

3916
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,590
Meaning,

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,330
Or

And

3937
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:01,740
could

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:04,860
they

3950
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,400
exist?

3951
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes.

3952
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:06,360
Yeah,

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,780
we

3954
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:06,990

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:30,330
the

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,270
for

00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:33,960
the

4198
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,430
that

4199
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,090
paranoia,

4200
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,050
people's

4201
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,350

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:37,860
turned

4205
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,130
around

4206
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,280
by

4207
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:38,700
these,

4208
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,300
we

4209
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,450
should

4210
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:39,870
clarify

4213
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:40,890
you

4214
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,190
mean

4215
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,550
not

4216
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,030

4217
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,150
in

4218
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,390
the

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:42,900
the

00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,470
qualitative

4222
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:43,800
sense?

4223
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:43,890
You

4224
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,070
mean

4225
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,400
positive,

4226
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:44,700
meaning

4227
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:44,850
that

4228
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:44,970
the

4229
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:45,420
appearance

4230
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:45,630
of

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,110
something

4232
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,590
abnormal?

4233
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,250
Exactly,

4234
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,460
yeah,

4235
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,730
thank

4236
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:47,790
you

4237
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:47,940
for

4238
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,060
that

4239
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:48,750
clarification.

4240
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:48,930
When

4241
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,020
we

4242
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,200
say

4243
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,950
positive

4244
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,430
symptoms,

4245
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:50,700
we do

4246
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,000
mean

4247
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,180
the

4248
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:51,630
addition

4249
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:51,720
of

4250
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,080
something

4251
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:52,230
that

4252
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,500
wasn't

4253
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:52,710
there

4254
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,130
before

4255
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:53,340
like

4256
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,430
a

4257
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,150
hallucination

4258
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,330
or a

4259
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:54,900
paranoia.

4260
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,560
And

4261
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:55,770
that

4262
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,130
stands

4263
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:56,220
in

4264
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,790
contrast

4265
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:56,850
to

4266
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:56,940
the

4267
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,270
negative

4268
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,750
symptoms

4269
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,140
where

4270
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,590
something

4271
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:58,710
is

4272
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,010
taken

4273
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,430
away

4274
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,550
and

4275
00:24:59,550 --> 00:24:59,730
these

4276
00:24:59,730 --> 00:24:59,940
are

4277
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,420
Patients

4278
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:00,600
who

4279
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:00,930
are

4280
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,710
who

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:01,830
are

4282
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,550
withdrawn,

4283
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,090
they

4284
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:03,630
have

4285
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,080
what

4286
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,170
we

4287
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:04,380
call

4288
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,740
thought

4289
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,220
blocking,

4290
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,340
they

4291
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,610
can't

4292
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:05,820
even

4293
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,270
progress

4294
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,630
forward

4295
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,780
in a

4296
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,260
sequence

4297
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,680
of

4298
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,250
thoughts.

4299
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:09,540
Both

4300
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,600
of

4301
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:09,810
those

4302
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:09,960
can

4303
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,020
be

4304
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,230
part

4305
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:10,290
of

4306
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,010
schizophrenia,

4307
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,430
the

4308
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,570
the

4309
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:13,800
hallucinations,

4310
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:13,890
and

4311
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:13,950
the

4312
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,490
paranoia

4313
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:14,670
are

4314
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:14,880
more

4315
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,330
effectively

4316
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:15,630
treated

4317
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:15,750
right

4318
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:15,900
now,

4319
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,080
but

4320
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,230
they

4321
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,470
are

4322
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,950
effectively

4323
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,340
treated.

4324
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,420
And

4325
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,720
then,

4326
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:18,840
you

4327
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,200
know,

4328
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:19,680
this

4329
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,100
is a

4330
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,150
frustrating,

4331
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,630
and

4332
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:21,930
yet

4333
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,590
heartening

4334
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,040
aspect

4335
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,130
of

4336
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,910
psychiatry,

4337
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,150
there

4338
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:24,510
are

4339
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:24,960
treatments

4340
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,200
like

4341
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,560
electro

4342
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,100
convulsive

4343
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:26,850
electroconvulsive

4344
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,270
therapy,

4345
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,510
which

4346
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,930
is

4347
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,590
where

4348
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:28,800
you

4349
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,100
know,

4350
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,400
it's

4351
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,060
extremely

4352
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,510
effective

4353
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:30,630
for

4354
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,140
depression,

4355
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,260
we

4356
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,650
have

4357
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,400
patients

4358
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,730
who

4359
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,570
nothing

4360
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:33,780
else

4361
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,050
works

4362
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,170
for

4363
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:34,680
them,

4364
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,610
where

4365
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:35,700
they

4366
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:35,970
can't

4367
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,330
tolerate

4368
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,290
medications.

4369
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,890
And

4370
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,060
you

4371
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,360
can

00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:39,990

they're

00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,400
body

4395
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,670
doesn't

4396
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,000
move

4397
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,120
or

4398
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,570
sees

4399
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:48,720
it's

4400
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:48,930
just

4401
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,050
an

4402
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,710
internal

4403
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,360
process

4404
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,540
that's

4405
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:51,840
triggered

4406
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:51,930
in

4407
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:51,990
the

4408
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,320
brain.

4409
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:52,950
This

4410
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,160
is an

4411
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
extraordinarily

4412
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,420
effective

4413
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:54,840
treatment

4414
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,170
for

4415
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:55,500
treatment

4416
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:55,890
resistant

4417
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,460
depression.

4418
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,060
At

4419
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,120
the

4420
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,390
same

4421
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:57,600
time,

4422
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:57,720
I

4423
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,020
find

4424
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,310
it as

4425
00:25:59,310 --> 00:25:59,670
heartening

4426
00:25:59,670 --> 00:25:59,880
as it

4427
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,180
is to

4428
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,600
see

4429
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,050
patients

4430
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:01,680
respond

4431
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:01,920
to

4432
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,190
this

4433
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,430
with

4434
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:02,820
with

4435
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:03,660
who

4436
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:03,810
have

4437
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,110
severe

4438
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,620
depression.

4439
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,130
I'm

4440
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,370
also

4441
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:05,910
frustrated

4442
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,180
by it

4443
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,570
Why

4444
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,810
Why

4445
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,080
can't

4446
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,440
we do

4447
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,800
something

4448
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,010
more

4449
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,610
precise

4450
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:08,940
than

4451
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,180
than

4452
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,540
this

4453
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:09,900
for

4454
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,050
these

4455
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:10,320
very

4456
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,650
severe

4457
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,190
cases?

4458
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:11,790
And

4459
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,240
people

4460
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:12,660
saw

4461
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:12,750
it

4462
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:12,960
for

4463
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,560
decades

4464
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,650
to

4465
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,370
understand,

4466
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,210
how

4467
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:15,450
is it

4468
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:15,600
that

4469
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:15,870
a

4470
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,410
seizure

4471
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:16,920
is

4472
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,400
leading

4473
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,640
to

4474
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:17,730
the

4475
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,150
relief

4476
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,390
of

4477
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,050
depression?

4478
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:19,140
And

4479
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,230
we

4480
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,410
don't

4481
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:19,560
know

4482
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:19,650
the

4483
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:19,950
answer

4484
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,220
yet,

4485
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:20,580
we

4486
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:20,700
would

4487
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:20,940
love

4488
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,210
to do

4489
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:21,510
that

4490
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:21,810
people

4491
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:21,900
are

4492
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:22,200
working

4493
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,440
hard

4494
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,590
on

4495
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:22,890
that.

4496
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:23,580
But

4497
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:23,730
that

4498
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:23,880
is a

4499
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,210
treatment

4500
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,330
that

4501
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:24,510
does

4502
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:24,780
work

4503
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,050
to

4504
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:25,980
all

4505
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,250
in

4506
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:26,460
all

4507
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:26,640
these

4508
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,030
cases,

4509
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,210
though,

4510
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:27,330
in

4511
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,080
psychiatry,

4512
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,650
the

4513
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,280
frustrating

4514
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,520
thing

4515
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,640
is

4516
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:29,760
that

4517
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:29,880
we

4518
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,150
don't

4519
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,660
have

4520
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,190
the

4521
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,700
level

4522
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,790
of

4523
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,510
understanding

4524
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,660
that

4525
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:33,720
a

4526
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,500
cardiologist

4527
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:34,800
has

4528
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:34,920
and

4529
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,190
thinking

4530
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,460
about

4531
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,550
the

4532
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:35,880
heart,

4533
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,000
you

4534
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,120
know,

4535
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,180
the

4536
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,450
heart

4537
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:36,990
is we

4538
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,170
now

4539
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:37,620
know

4540
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:37,830
it's

4541
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,860
a

4542
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,220
pump,

4543
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:38,400
it's

4544
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:38,820
pumping

4545
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,180
blood.

4546
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,450
And

4547
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:39,600
so

4548
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:39,690
you

4549
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:39,870
can

4550
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,110
look

4551
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,380
at

4552
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,950
everything

4553
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,460
about

4554
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,090
how

4555
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,210
it's

4556
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:42,660
working,

4557
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:42,810
or

4558
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,020
not

4559
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,380
working

4560
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,560
in

4561
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:43,920
terms

4562
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,040
of

4563
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,400
that

4564
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,240
frame.

4565
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:45,630
It's

4566
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,080
clearly

4567
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,170
a

4568
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:46,440
pump.

4569
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,310
We

4570
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,520
don't

4571
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:47,910
really

4572
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,420
have

4573
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:48,810
that

4574
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,200
level

4575
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,500
of

4576
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,640
what

4577
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:50,940
what

4578
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,060
is

4579
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,210
the

4580
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,720
circuit

4581
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:51,960
really,

4582
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,500
therefore

4583
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:52,710
in

4584
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,490
psychiatry,

4585
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,570
and

4586
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,260
that's,

4587
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,560
that's

4588
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:55,830
what

4589
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,250
is

4590
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:56,850
missing?

4591
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,210
That's

4592
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:57,540
what

4593
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:57,960
we

4594
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,170
need

4595
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,230
to

4596
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:58,620
find.

4597
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:58,860
So we

4598
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,010
can

4599
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,460
design

4600
00:26:59,490 --> 00:26:59,940
truly

4601
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,420
effective

4602

So

4615
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,100
going

4616
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,250

4625
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,270
I

4626
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,390
would

4627
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,140
imagine,

4628
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:13,770
there

4629
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:13,800
are

4630
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,190
several

4631
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,670
elements

4632
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:14,790
and

4633
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,270
bins

4634
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:15,720
here.

4635
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,010
Understanding

4636
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,190
that

4637
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,550
the

4638
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,090
natural

4639
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,780

4640
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,710
understanding

4641
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,340
what

4642
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,430
the

4643
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:20,820
activity

4644
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,210
patterns

4645
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:21,420
are,

4646
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:21,540
how

4647
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:21,630
to

4648
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,020
modify

4649
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,230
those,

4650
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,740
maybe

4651
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,490
you

4652
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,640
could

4653
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,030
just

4654
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,300
tell

4655
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:24,420
us

4656
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,600

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,750
you

4658
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,170
think,

4659
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,440
what

4660
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:25,560
is

4661
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:25,830
the

4662
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,010

4669
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,340
Yeah,

4670
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,150
I

4671
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,390
think

4672
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,450
the

4673
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:30,720

4676
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,230
need

4677
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:31,320
is

4678
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,890
understanding

4679
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,010
we

4680
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,490
need

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:32,760
we

4682
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,210
need

4683
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,440
almost

4684
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,650

serendipitously

4690
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,620
identified,

4691
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:37,890
just

4692
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,280
noting,

4693
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,460
by

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,150
that

4696
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,600
something

4697
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,720
that

4698
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,140
was

4699
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:40,920
done

4700
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,820
for

4716
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,040
Is it

4717
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,250
true

4718
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:47,400
that

4719
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,490
it

4720
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:47,670
was

4721
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:47,880

4735
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:51,840
that

4736
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,080
made

4737
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,230
them

4738
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,500
not

4739
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,860
manic?

4740
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,010
Is

4741
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,220
that

4742
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,580
true?

4743
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:53,910
I

4744
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,090
don't

4745
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,300
have

4746
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,570

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,410
that.

4751
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,310
But I

4752
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,460
would

4753
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:56,760
defer

4754
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,030
that,

4755
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,420
but

4756
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,690
it's

4757
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:57,930
true

4758
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,260
for

4759
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,800
essentially

4760
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,070
every

4761
00:27:59,070 --> 00:27:59,490
treatment,

4762
00:27:59,490 --> 00:27:59,580
you

4763
00:27:59,580 --> 00:27:59,700
know,

4764
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,060
the

4765
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,930
antidepressants

4766
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,620
originally,

4767
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,130
you

4768
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,400
know,

4769
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,270
roses,

4770
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,470

example.

4774
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,420
And

4775
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,540
so

4776
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:06,690
this

4777
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,200
is a

4778
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,680
classic

4779
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,160

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,580
for,

4781
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,080
and

4782
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,380
this

4783
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:10,500
is

4784
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,890
across

4785
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,100

4788
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,050
And

4789
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:13,140
of

4790
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,440
course,

4791
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,620
there's

4792
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:13,710
the

well,

4796
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:14,490
that

4797
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:14,640
was

4798
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:14,970
noticed

4799
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,120
that

4800
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,480
patients

4801
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:15,600
who

4802
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:15,840
had

4803
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,410

4804
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:16,650
they

4805
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,430

4807
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,150
there

4808
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,360
and

4809
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:18,660
also

4810
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:18,840
had

4811
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,260
depression

4812
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:19,380
that

4813
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,470
they

4814
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,830
became

4815
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,280
much

4816
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:20,670
at

4817
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:20,910
least

4818
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,060
for a

4819
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,420
while

4820
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,510
they

4821
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:21,660
were

4822
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,110
improved

4823
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,530
after

4824
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,160
seizure.

4825
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:23,790
That's

4826
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,210
amazing.

4827
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,300
I

4828
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,420
don't

4829
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:24,540
want

4830
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:24,600
to

4831
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,690
take

4832
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:24,750
you

4833
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:24,930
off

4834
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:25,200
course.

4835
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:25,260
So

4836
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:25,380
the

4837
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:25,800
question

4838
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,010
that

4839
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,550
answering

4840
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:26,610
the

4841
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:26,910
question

4842
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:27,000
I

4843
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,210
asked,

4844
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,480
but

4845
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,380
I've

4846
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:28,560
heard

4847
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,010
before

4848
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:29,340
that

4849
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,640
if

4850
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,180
autistic

4851
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,540
children

4852
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:30,750
get a

4853
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,260
fever

4854
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,470
that

4855
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:31,590
their

4856
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,040
symptoms

4857
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,580
improve?

4858
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,030
Is

4859
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,210
that

4860
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:33,480
true?

4861
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,590
I've

4862
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:34,740
done

4863
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:34,800
a

4864
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,010
fair

4865
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,160
bit

4866
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,640
of

4867
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:35,940
work

4868
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,510
with

4869
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,260
autism.

4870
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,070
In my

4871
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,400
clinical

4872
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,820
practice,

4873
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:38,910
I

4874
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,180
work

4875
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,330
with

4876
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,660
adult

4877
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,200
autism.

4878
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,440
And I

4879
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,650
have

4880
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,100
heard

4881
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,030
statements

4882
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,210
like

4883
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,450
that

4884
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:42,750
and

4885
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,200
descriptions

4886
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,380
like

4887
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,590
that

4888
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,950
from

4889
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,190
from

4890
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:44,610
patients

4891
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:44,730
and

4892
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,090
their

4893
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,660
families.

4894
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:46,890
It's

4895
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:47,370
a

4896
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:47,910
it's

4897
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,270
that

4898
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,390
is

4899
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,780
very

4900
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:48,990
hard

4901
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,050
to

4902
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,590
study

4903
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,250
quantitatively,

4904
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,550
because

4905
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:50,850
often

4906
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:50,940
with

4907
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,030
the

4908
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,420
children,

4909
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:51,480
you

4910
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:51,690
have

4911
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,050
this

4912
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,480
not

4913
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:54,750
as

4914
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,290
quantitative

4915
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:55,440
as

4916
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,560
you'd

4917
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:55,830
like

4918
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,280
collection

4919
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,370
of

4920
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:56,700
symptom

4921
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,420
information

4922
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,020
from

4923
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,410
from

4924
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,160
from

4925
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,430
home.

4926
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,510
But I

4927
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:00,690
have

4928
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:00,840
heard

4929
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,020
that

4930
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,290
enough

4931
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:01,410
that

4932
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:01,500
I

4933
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:01,740
think

4934
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,130
there

4935
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,310
may

4936
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,490
well

4937
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:02,610
be

4938
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,000
something

4939
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,180
to

4940
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:03,450
that.

4941
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,800
And

4942
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,130
you

4943
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:05,430
know,

4944
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:05,760
what

4945
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,360
is

4946
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,200
anytime

4947
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,290
you

4948
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:07,440
have

4949
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,500
a

4950
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,100
fever,

4951
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,400
what's

4952
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:08,670
going

4953
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:08,940
on?

4954
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:09,060
Well,

4955
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,180
we

4956
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,660
know

4957
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:09,960
all

4958
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,110
the

4959
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,830
cells

4960
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:10,920
in

4961
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:10,980
the

4962
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,490
brain,

4963
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:11,940
and I

4964
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,120
know

4965
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,300
this

4966
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,540
is an

4967
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,560
electrophysiologist.

4968
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:13,710
If

4969
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:13,830
you

4970
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,040
just

4971
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,370
change

4972
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:14,460
the

4973
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:14,910
temperature

4974
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:15,090
by a

4975
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,270
few

4976
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,600
degrees,

4977
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:15,990
everything

4978
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,380
changes

4979
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:16,650
about

4980
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:16,890
how

4981
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,310
neurons

4982
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,550
work.

4983
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:17,670
And

4984
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:17,820
that's

4985
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,090
even

4986
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,300
just

4987
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,330
a

4988
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:18,630
single

4989
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,050
neuron.

4990
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:19,650
It's

4991
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:19,890
even

4992
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,430
more

4993
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,180
likely

4994
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,420
to be

4995
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:21,990
complex

4996
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,110
and

4997
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,380
different

4998
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,530
with

4999
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:22,590
a

5000
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:22,980
circuit

5001
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,070
of

5002
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,520
neurons

5003
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:23,610
that

5004
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:23,700
are

5005
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:23,850
all

5006
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,270
affecting

5007
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:24,450
each

5008
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:24,840
other.

5009
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,320
Just

5010
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,680
elevate

5011
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:25,770
the

5012
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,160
temperature

5013
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,190
a

5014
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:26,370
little

5015
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,580
bit.

5016
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,210
Everything's

5017
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:27,600
different.

5018
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,900
And

5019
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,200
so

5020
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,560
it's

5021
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:28,950
it's

5022
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,880
plausible

5023
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,180
for

5024
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,480
sure

5025
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,600
that

5026
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:30,870
things

5027
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,020
like

5028
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,320
that

5029
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,650
could

5030
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,010
happen

5031
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,160
and

5032
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,250
do

5033
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,640
happen.

5034
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,780
Now.

5035
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:34,530
But

5036
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:34,740
and

5037
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,010
yet,

5038
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,730
when

5039
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:35,820
you

5040
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,000
think

5041
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,180
about

5042
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:36,600
autism

5043
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:36,690
to

5044
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:36,900
take

5045
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,020
your

5046
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,560
example.

5047
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,480
Yes,

5048
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,600
we

5049
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:39,750
see

5050
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,410
changes.

5051
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,220
But

5052
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:42,570
what

5053
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,020
is

5054
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,560
the

5055
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,130
elements

5056
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,190
of

5057
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,250
the

5058
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:44,520
brain

5059
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:44,670
that's

5060
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,270
analogous

5061
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,390
to

5062
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:45,540
the

5063
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:45,990
pumping

5064
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,470
heart

5065
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,800
when

5066
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:46,890
we

5067
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,100
think

5068
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,340
about

5069
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,400
the

5070
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,000
symptoms

5071
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,450
of

5072
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,170
depression?

5073
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,220
That's

5074
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:50,670
maybe

5075
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:50,820
you

5076
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,060
know,

5077
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,330
we

5078
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,570
think

5079
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:51,840
about

5080
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,530
motivation

5081
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:52,650
and

5082
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,070
dopamine

5083
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,430
neurons.

5084
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:54,060
When

5085
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,150
we

5086
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:54,300
think

5087
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,510
about

5088
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,140
autism,

5089
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:55,440
it's

5090
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,500
a

5091
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,070
little

5092
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,400
more

5093
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,120
challenging.

5094
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,080
You

5095
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,230
had

5096
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,440
there's

5097
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:58,890
a

5098
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,000
deficit

5099
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
In

5100
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,950
social

5101
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,480
interaction

5102
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,810
and

5103
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,080
in

5104
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,800
communication.

5105
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,570
And

5106
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:06,720
so

5107
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,080
where's

5108
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,260
that?

5109
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:07,770
Where's

5110
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,070
this?

5111
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:08,880
Where's

5112
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,090
that

5113
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,810
situated?

5114
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,080
What

5115
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,200
is

5116
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,620
the

5117
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:10,950
key

5118
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,640
principle,

5119
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,350
governing

5120
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,500
the

5121
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,920
social

5122
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,730
interaction?

5123
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:15,810
This

5124
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,200
is

5125
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,560
where

5126
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:16,650
we

5127
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:16,830
need

5128
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:16,920
the

5129
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,310
basic

5130
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,760
science

5131
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:17,970
to

5132
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,210
bring

5133
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:18,420
us a

5134
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,690
step

5135
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,140
forward.

5136
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,560
So we

5137
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:19,650
can

5138
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:19,770
say,

5139
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,190
Okay,

5140
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:20,490
this

5141
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:20,670
is

5142
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:20,760
the

5143
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,210
process

5144
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,360
that's

5145
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,630
going

5146
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:21,810
on,

5147
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:21,960
this

5148
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,080
is

5149
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,290
what's

5150
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:22,830
needed

5151
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,370
for

5152
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:23,490
the

5153
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,090
incredibly

5154
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:24,750
complex

5155
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,170
task

5156
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,380
of

5157
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:25,830
social

5158
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,460
interaction,

5159
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,120
where

5160
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,240
you've

5161
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,540
got

5162
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,500
incredibly

5163
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:28,770
rich

5164
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,010
data

5165
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:29,550
streams

5166
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:29,820
of

5167
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,540
sound

5168
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:30,690
and

5169
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:31,200
meaning

5170
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,380
eye

5171
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:31,980
contact

5172
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,220
body

5173
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:32,820
movements,

5174
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,240
and

5175
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,360
that's

5176
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:33,570
just

5177
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:33,660
for

5178
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:33,840
one

5179
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,230
person,

5180
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,470
or if

5181
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,650
there's

5182
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:34,710
a

5183
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:34,920
group

5184
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,010
of

5185
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:35,430
people,

5186
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:36,330
this

5187
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:36,630
is

5188
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,380
overwhelming

5189
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:37,530
for

5190
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:37,860
people

5191
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,100
with

5192
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:38,280
with

5193
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,880
autism.

5194
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:39,840
what's

5195
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,380
the

5196
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:40,920
what's

5197
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,040
the

5200
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:41,910
there?

5201
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,120
It's

5202
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,480
a lot

5203
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,600
of

5204
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,260
information.

5205
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:43,980
And,

5206
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,490
and

5207
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,090
that

5208
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:45,720
maybe

5209
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:45,840
is

5210
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,470
unmatched

5211
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,560

5212
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,100
any

5214
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,000

biology,

5216
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:48,600
the

5218
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:48,870

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,360
particularly

5226
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,510
with

5227
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,930
words

5228
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,230
and

5229
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,740
language.

5230
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,000
And

5231
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,150
so

5232
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,570
then,

5233
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,140
that

5234
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,440
turns

5235
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:55,530
our

5236
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,100
attention

5237
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,280
as

5238
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,000
neuroscientists,

5239
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,150
we

5240
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,420
think,

5241
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:57,840
okay,

5242
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:58,860
let's

5243
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,070
think

5244
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,280
about

5245
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,370
the

5246
00:30:59,370 --> 00:30:59,640
parts

5247
00:30:59,640 --> 00:30:59,700
of

5248
00:30:59,700 --> 00:30:59,760
the

5249
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,090
brain

5250
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:00,240
that

5251
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,960
are

5252
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,680
involved

5253
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,250
in

5254
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,760
dealing

5255
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,210
with

5256
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,770
merging

5257
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,580
complex

5258
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:05,880
data

5259
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,450
streams

5260
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:06,600
that

5261
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:06,780
are

5262
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,200
very

5263
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,590
high

5264
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:07,770
in

5265
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,280
bitrate

5266
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,670
that

5267
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,120
need

5268
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,300
to be

5269
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,660
fused

5270
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,170
together

5271
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:10,470
into

5272
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:10,530
a

5273
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,040
unitary

5274
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,700
concept.

5275
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,230
And

5276
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:13,470
that

5277
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:13,800
starts

5278
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:13,890
to

5279
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:14,190
guide

5280
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,400
us.

5281
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:14,520
And

5282
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:14,700
maybe

5283
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:14,790
we

5284
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,150
can,

5285
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,360
and

5286
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,450
we

5287
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:15,660
know

5288
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:15,840
how

5289
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,170
other

5290
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:16,560
animals

5291
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,650
are

5292
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:17,100
social

5293
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:17,220
in

5294
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:17,340
their

5295
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,520
own

5296
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:17,790
way.

5297
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:17,880
And

5298
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,000
we

5299
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,150
can

5300
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,450
study

5301
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:18,630
those

5302
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,050
animals

5303
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,170
and

5304
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:19,290
so

5305
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:19,530
that

5306
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:19,920
there's,

5307
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:20,190
that's

5308
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,520
how I

5309
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:20,760
think

5310
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,030
about

5311
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,120
it,

5312
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,300
there's

5313
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:21,480
hope

5314
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,570
for

5315
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:21,660
the

5316
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,110
future,

5317
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,710
thinking

5318
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,130
about

5319
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,610
the

5320
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,000
symptoms

5321
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,210
as an

5322
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:24,600
engineer

5323
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:24,990
might,

5324
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,250
and

5325
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,760
trying

5326
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:26,880
to

5327
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,420
identify

5328
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:27,540
the

5329
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,050
circuits

5330
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,290
that

5331
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,530
are

5332
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,010
likely

5333
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,580
working

5334
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,300
to

5335
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:30,540
make

5336
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,050
this

5337
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,530
typical

5338
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:31,950
behavior

5339
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,370
happen,

5340
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:32,580
and

5341
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:32,730
that

5342
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:32,820
will

5343
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,000
help

5344
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,120
us

5345
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,630
understand

5346
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:33,780
how

5347
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:33,840
it

5348
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,290
becomes

5349
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:34,410
a

5350
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:34,920
typical.

5351
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,220
So

5352
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,370
that

5353
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,610
seems

5354
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:35,790
like

5355
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:35,880
the

5356
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,540
first,

5357
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,470
to me

5358
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,620
the

5359
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:37,890
first

5360
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,250
been

5361
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:38,400
of

5362
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,850
this

5363
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,120
what

5364
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,210
I

5365
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,450
call

5366
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:39,540
the

5367
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,870

5368
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,350
box,

5369
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,160
for

5370
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,400
lack

5371
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,210
of a

5372
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,510
better

5373
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,020
analogy,

5374
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,320
that

5375
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,560
we

5376
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:43,740
need

5377
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,800
to

5378
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,160
know

5379
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,280
the

00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:44,670
circuits

5381
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:44,790
we

5382
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:44,940
need

5383
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,030
to

5384
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,390
know

5385
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,570
the

5386
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,170

5387
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:46,800
in

5388
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:46,860
the

5389
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,160
various

5392
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:47,940
and

5393
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,150
end

5394
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:48,570
portions

5395
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:48,660
of

00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:48,750

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,680
and,

5399
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:50,550
and

5400
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:50,700
how

5401
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:50,790
they

5402
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,090
connect

another.

5406
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,620
And

5407
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,190
what

5408
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,250
the

interaction.

5420
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,910
If we

5421
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,570
understand

5422
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,110
that,

5423
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:01,800
then

5424
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:01,890
it

5425
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,280
seems

5426
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,820
that

5434
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:04,920
be

5435
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,160
carried

5436
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,340
out

5437
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,430
in

5438
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,970
parallel,

5439
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,300
right,

5440
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,450
that

5441
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:06,570
though

5442
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,690
that

5443
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:06,870
work

5444
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,990
can

5445
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,080
be

5446
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,620
done

5447
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,580
alongside

5448
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:08,970
work,

5449
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,900
where

5450
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,130
various

5451
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:11,700
elements

5452
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,940
within

5453
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,120
those

5454
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,450
circuits

5455
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:12,570
are

5456
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:12,990
tweaked

5457
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,380
just

5458
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,740
right,

5459
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,280
like

5460
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:14,370
the

5461
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:14,670
tuning

5462
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:14,820
of a

5463
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,300
piano

5464
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,420
and

5465
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,510
the

5466
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:15,870
subtle

5467
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,170
white,

5468
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:16,320
or

5469
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,500
maybe

5470
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:16,650
even

5471
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:16,800
like

5472
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:16,860
the

5473
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,400
replacement

5474
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,520
of a

5475
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:17,670
whole

5476
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:17,850
set

5477
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:17,910
of

5478
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,300
keys,

5479
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:18,420
if

5480
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:18,660
the

5481
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,140
piano

5482
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:19,260
is

5483
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:19,680
lacking

5484
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:19,920
key,

5485
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,220
so to

5486
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,520
speak,

5487
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:21,870
you've

5488
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,020
been

5489
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,230
very

5490
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,650
involved

5491
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:22,890
in

5492
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,160
trying

5493
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,220
to

5494
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,850
generate

5495
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,330
those

5496
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:24,810
tools.

5497
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,380
So

5498
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,700
tell

5499
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:26,880
us

5500
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,510
about

5501
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,500
channel

5502
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,190
options,

5503
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:29,970
why

5504
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:30,420
you

5505
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,320
created

5506
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,620
them,

5507
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,490
and

5508
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,120
where

5509
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,330
they're

5510
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:33,570
at

5511
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,170
now,

5512
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:34,950
in

5513
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,190
the

5514
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,000
laboratory,

5515
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,510
and

5516
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,050
perhaps

5517
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,410
also

5518
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:37,530
in

5519
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:37,620
the

5520
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,130
clinic?

5521
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:38,700
Well,

5522
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:38,880
this

5523
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,450
is a

5524
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:39,810
first

5525
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:39,870
of

5526
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:39,930
all,

5527
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:39,990
I

5528
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,200
give

5529
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,800
nature,

5530
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,120
credit

5531
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:42,660
for

5532
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,110
creating

5533
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,440
channel

5534
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:43,980
adoptions.

5535
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,160
These

5536
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,280
are

5537
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,090
beautiful

5538
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,630
little

5539
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,260
proteins

5540
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,470
that

5541
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,800
are

5542
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,100
made

5543
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,490
by

5544
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,120
algae,

5545
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,480
single

5546
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:48,870

5547
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,140
green

5548
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,590
algae.

5549
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,970
And

5550
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,300
it's

5551
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,360
a

5552
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,600
great

5553
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,170
story

5554
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,350
in

5555
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:52,680
basic

5556
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,160
science,

5557
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,460
that

5558
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,270
our

5559
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:54,870
understanding

5560
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,230
of

5561
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,520
animal

5562
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,390
behavior,

5563
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,230
sensation,

5564
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,800
cognition

5565
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:58,920
and

5566
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,280
action

5567
00:32:59,280 --> 00:32:59,370
in

5568
00:32:59,370 --> 00:32:59,490
our

5569
00:32:59,490 --> 00:32:59,940
brains,

5570
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:00,900
all

5571
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:00,960
the

5572
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,440
way

5573
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,160
back

5574
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,400
to a

5575
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,120
botanist

5576
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:03,540
in

5577
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,080
the

5578
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,040
1850s.

5579
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,130
And

5580
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,060
1860s,

5581
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,240
in

5582
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,690
Russia,

5583
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:07,230
is

5584
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:07,380
where

5585
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,470
the

5586
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:07,770
story

5587
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,250
begins.

5588
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:08,730
So

5589
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:08,970
this

5590
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,690
was a

5591
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,140
a

5592
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,830
botanist

5593
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,130
named

5594
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:11,430
Andre

5595
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,150
minsan,

5596
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:12,870
who

5597
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:13,650
worked

5598
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:13,770
at

5599
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:14,010
St.

5600
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,730
Petersburg.

5601
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,300
And

5602
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,470
he

5603
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,920
had

5604
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,310
noticed

5605
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,460
in

5606
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:17,550
the

5607
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,060
river

5608
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,110
near

5609
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,320

laboratory

5611
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,130
that

5612
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,280
there

5613
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:20,790
were

5614
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,720
algae

5615
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,350
that

5616
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,470
he

5617
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,620
could

5618
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:22,830
look

5619
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,100
at,

5620
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,000
in a

5621
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:24,390
ditch

5622
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:24,570
and a

5623
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,080
saucer,

5624
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,290
he

5625
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:25,590
could

5626
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,190
put

5627
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:26,340
them

5628
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,550
there

5629
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:26,640
and

5630
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:26,790
we

5631
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:26,970
had

5632
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:27,270
light

5633
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,600
shining

5634
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:27,780
from

5635
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:27,870
the

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,350
side.

5637
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,790
The

5638
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,540

5640
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,010

water

5645
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,160
would

5650
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,430
from

5653
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:38,910
that

5654
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,000
he

5655
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,120
was

5656
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,420
shining

5657
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:39,600

5658
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:39,690
the

5660
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,590
which

5661
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:40,740
was

5662
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:40,860
an

5663
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,220
amazing

5664
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,550
thing.

5665
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,690
If he

5666
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:42,900
made

5667
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:42,960
the

5668
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,260
light

5669
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,070
brighter,

5670
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,060
the

5671
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,390
green

5672
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:45,720
tinge

5673
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:45,870
would

5674
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:46,140
back

5675
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,620

5678
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,280
to a

location.

5682
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:48,720
So

5683
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:48,960
just

5684
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,050

5688
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:50,580
So

5689
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:50,730
this

5690
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,030

5699
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:54,810
And

5700
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,020
he

5701
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,440
delves

5707
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:56,280
he

5708
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,060
identified

5709
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,300

00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:58,830
he

5712
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:58,980
could

5713
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,250

for

6058
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,240
cognition,

6059
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,360
what

6060
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:12,660
matters

6061
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:12,780
for

6062
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,110
action,

6063
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,260
and

6064
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,320
we

6065
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,530
call

6066
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:13,740
this

6067
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:14,670
optogenetics.

6068
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,690
Beautiful,

6069
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,230
and I

6070
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,620
must

6071
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:16,830
say,

6072
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:16,890
it

6073
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,070
was

6074
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,430
quite

6075
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,210
an

6076
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:18,510
honor

6077
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,660
and a

6078
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,110
privilege

6079
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,290
to

6080
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,950
watch

6081
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,360
optogenetics

6082
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,900
move

6083
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:22,650
from

6084
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,490
idea

6085
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,670
to

6086
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,510
discovery

6087
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,680
to

6088
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:25,980
the

6089
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,760
laboratory,

6090
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,880
I

6091
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,030
think

6092
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,150
we

6093
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,270
were

6094
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,900
postdocs

6095
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,020
at

6096
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,110
the

6097
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,380
same

6098
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:28,800
time,

6099
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,340
which

6100
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:29,580
is

6101
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,060
living

6102
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,510
proof

6103
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:30,870
that

6104
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,320
people

6105
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,530
move

6106
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:31,590
at

6107
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:31,890
different

6108
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,310
rates.

6109
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,170
That's

6110
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:34,500
a

6111
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:34,860
joke,

6112
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,370
at my

6113
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:35,790
expense,

6114
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,940
by

6115
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,060
the

6116
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,210
way.

6117
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:37,920
But

6118
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,070
it's

6119
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,220
we

6120
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,400
live

6121
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,490
in

6122
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:38,550
the

6123
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,760
same

6124
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,060
spot.

6125
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,360
Physically,

6126
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,510
if

6127
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:42,900
not

6128
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,190
professionally,

6129
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,430
but

6130
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,480
nonetheless,

6131
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:45,930
it's

6132
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,140
been

6133
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,470
a

6134
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,190
marvelous

6135
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,610
story

6136
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:47,880
thus

6137
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,390
far.

6138
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:48,600
And

6139
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:48,750
I'd

6140
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,020
like

6141
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,230
to,

6142
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,130
maybe

6143
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:50,190
you

6144
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,310
could

6145
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,460
give

6146
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,640
us

6147
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:50,880
I'd

6148
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,000
like

6149
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,090
to

6150
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,330
just

6151
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:51,540
touch

6152
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,140
on a

6153
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,590
couple

6154
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,250
examples

6155
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,370
of

6156
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:53,970
where

6157
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,600
the

6158
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,260
technology

6159
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:55,740
resides

6160
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:55,860
in

6161
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,580
laboratories

6162
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:56,820
now.

6163
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:56,970
So

6164
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:57,210
maybe

6165
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:57,300
the

6166
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:57,630
range

6167
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:57,720
of

6168
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,110
animals

6169
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,260
that

6170
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,380
it's

6171
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,560
being

6172
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:58,860
used

6173
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,130
in

6174
00:36:59,460 --> 00:36:59,640
and

6175
00:36:59,640 --> 00:36:59,850
some

6176
00:36:59,850 --> 00:36:59,910
of

6177
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,970
the

6178
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:00,690
phenomenon

6179
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,080
that

6180
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,250
channel

6181
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,550
up

6182
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:02,880
chelmer,

6183
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,390
adoptions

6184
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:03,720
and,

6185
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,230
and

6186
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,350
their

6187
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:04,920
related

6188
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,610
genes

6189
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:05,730
and

6190
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,180
proteins

6191
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,570
are

6192
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,010
starting

6193
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:08,130
to

6194
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,670
elicit

6195
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:08,970
what

6196
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,150
you've

6197
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,690
seen.

6198
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,070
And

6199
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,220
then

6200
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,340
I'd

6201
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:11,460
like

6202
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:11,550
to

6203
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:11,760
talk

6204
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,120
about

6205
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,720
their

6206
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,440
applicability

6207
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,680
to

6208
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:13,800
the

6209
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,220
clinic,

6210
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:14,490
which

6211
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,240
is, I

6212
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,600
think

6213
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,840
that

6214
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,050
the

6215
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,380
bigger

6216
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:16,890
mission,

6217
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:17,129
if

6218
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:17,249
you

6219
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:17,519
will,

6220
00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:18,509
so

6221
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:18,719
this

6222
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,019
is,

6223
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:19,619
you

6224
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:19,859
know,

6225
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:20,429
this

6226
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:20,879
this

6227
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:21,749
whole

6228
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:22,229
thing,

6229
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:22,589
you

6230
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:22,679
know,

6231
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:22,799
it's

6232
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:22,979
been

6233
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:23,519
about

6234
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:24,269
now

6235
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:24,509
going

6236
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,499
on 17

6237
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:25,799
years

6238
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:25,889
that

6239
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:26,069
we've

6240
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,219
been

6241
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:26,549
putting

6242
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:26,849
channeler

6243
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:27,389
adoptions

6244
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:27,599
into

6245
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:28,109
neurons,

6246
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:28,589
it

6247
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:29,099
started

6248
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:29,369
just

6249
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:29,579
like

6250
00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:29,879
Andre,

6251
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:30,089
for

6252
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:30,389
instance,

6253
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:30,689
work

6254
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:31,169
in a

6255
00:37:31,169 --> 00:37:31,649

6256
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:32,729
by

6257
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:33,509
2000.

6258
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:33,719
That

6259
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:33,839
was

6260
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:33,929
in

6261
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:34,739
2004,

6262
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:34,859
and

6263
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:35,819
2007,

6264
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:35,999
we

6265
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,119
were

6266
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:36,419
putting

6267
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:36,719
these

6268
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,139
into

6269
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:37,739
behaving

6270
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:38,189
mice,

6271
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:38,309
and

6272
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:38,429
we

6273
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:38,519
were

6274
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:38,759
able

6275
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:39,089
to,

6276
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:39,629
with

6277
00:37:39,629 --> 00:37:39,719
a

6278
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:40,439
click

6279
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:40,799
of a

6280
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:41,909
switch

6281
00:37:41,939 --> 00:37:42,269
cause

6282
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:42,449
them

6283
00:37:42,449 --> 00:37:42,599
to

6284
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:42,839
move

6285
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:43,019
one

6286
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:43,469
direction

6287
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:43,559
or

6288
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:43,979
another

6289
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:44,879
by

6290
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:45,869
2009.

6291
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:46,079
So

6292
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:46,619
basically,

6293
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:46,859
you're

6294
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:47,429
controlling

6295
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:47,519
the

6296
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:47,939
mouse's

6297
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:48,329
behavior,

6298
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:48,539
yeah,

6299
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,110
exactly

6300
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,260
in

6301
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,440
real

6302
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,620
time,

6303
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:49,830
so we

6304
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:49,950
could

6305
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,190
make

6306
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,250
a

6307
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,550
mouse

6308
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,670
that

6309
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:50,790
was

6310
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,940
just

6311
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,150
sitting

6312
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:51,300
there

6313
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,540
doing

6314
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:51,990
nothing

6315
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:52,560
to

6316
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:52,800
then

6317
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,100
turn

6318
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,490
left

6319
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,000
very

6320
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,660
consistently,

6321
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:54,720
in

6322
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,020
fact,

6323
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,170
go

6324
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,470
around

6325
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:55,590
in a

6326
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:55,980
circle.

6327
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,070
And

6328
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,130
as

6329
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:56,250
soon

6330
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:56,430
as we

6331
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:56,610
turn

6332
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:56,790
off

6333
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,880
the

6334
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,090
light,

6335
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:57,150
it

6336
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,270
would

6337
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,660
stop,

6338
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,290
that

6339
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:58,590
was

6340
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,740
an

6341
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:58,890
eye

6342
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,190
opening

6343
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,610
moment.

6344
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:01,770
It

6345
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,070
took

6346
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,460
really

6347
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,730
a few

6348
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,120
years

6349
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,240
to

6350
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,480
make

6351
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,290
optogenetics

6352
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:04,680
work,

6353
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,100
there

6354
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,280
was a

6355
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,670
lot

6356
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,090
of

6357
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,470
putting

6358
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:07,770
all

6359
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,040
the

6360
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,220
there

6361
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,280
are a

6362
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,430
lot

6363
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:08,490
of

6364
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:08,790
problems

6365
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:08,880
that

6366
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,030
had

6367
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,210
to be

6368
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,600
solved

6369
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,140
these,

6370
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:10,440
these

6371
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,800
channels,

6372
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:10,920
and

6373
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,250
options

6374
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,580
actually

6375
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:11,970
don't

6376
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,480
move

6377
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:12,990
many

6378
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,950
ions

6379
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,130
there,

6380
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,310
they

6381
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,550
have

6382
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,700
a

6383
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,180
small

6384
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,600
current

6385
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:15,900
small

6386
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,500
conductance,

6387
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:16,770
as we

6388
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,100
say.

6389
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,250
And

6390
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:17,580
so we

6391
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:17,730
had

6392
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:17,790
to

6393
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,060
figure

6394
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,180
out

6395
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,480
ways

6396
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,690
to

6397
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:19,410
pack

6398
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:19,710
a lot

6399
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:19,770
of

6400
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,070
them

6401
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:20,400
into

6402
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,000
cells

6403
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,630
without

6404
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,080
damaging

6405
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,680
cells,

6406
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,640
and

6407
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:23,850
still

6408
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,060
make

6409
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,450
them

6410
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,140
targetable.

6411
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,380
So we

6412
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:25,590
don't

6413
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:25,710
want

6414
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:25,950
to

6415
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,310
just

6416
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:26,490
be in

6417
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:26,610
all

6418
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:26,700
the

6419
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,090
cells

6420
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,330
because

6421
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:27,780
then

6422
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,260
that

6423
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,590
becomes

6424
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:28,800
just

6425
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:28,980
like

6426
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,070
an

6427
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,520
electrode,

6428
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:29,610
you

6429
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:29,850
just

6430
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,000
didn't

6431
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,240
lighting

6432
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,390
all

6433
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:30,480
the

6434
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,780
cells

6435
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:30,870
that

6436
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,900
are

6437
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,230
nearby,

6438
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:31,380
we

6439
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,500
had

6440
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:31,590
to

6441
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:31,860
keep

6442
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,250
that

6443
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,330
specificity,

6444
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:33,900
make

6445
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,230
them

6446
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,640
targetable

6447
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:35,760
to

6448
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,000
just

6449
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,210
one

6450
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:36,480
kind

6451
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,570
of

6452
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:36,870
cell

6453
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,960
or

6454
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,440
another

6455
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,710
while

6456
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,010
still

6457
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,430
packing

6458
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:38,580
in

6459
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,910
large

6460
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,240
numbers

6461
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,330
of

6462
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:39,450
them

6463
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:39,690
into

6464
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:40,110
those

6465
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,650
cells.

6466
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,100
And

6467
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,190
we

6468
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,310
had

6469
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,370
to

6470
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:41,550
get

6471
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:41,670

6479
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:43,590
And

6480
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,160
so it

6481
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:44,580
took

6482
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,000

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:51,990
we

6504
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,440

00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,650
that

6681
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:07,740
it

6682
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,040
that

6683
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,130
it

6684
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:08,460
worked

6685
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,000
recording

6686
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,150
from

6687
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:09,240
the

6688
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,600
cells

6689
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:09,900
showing

6690
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,020
that

6691
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,110
in

6692
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:10,290
these

6693
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:10,740
human

6694
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,340
neurons,

6695
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:11,730
retinal

6696
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,180
neurons

6697
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,300
that

6698
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,390
you

6699
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,570
could

6700
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:12,900
get

6701
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,530
light

6702
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:14,220
responses.

6703
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:14,790
But

6704
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:15,210
then

6705
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:15,480
from

6706
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:15,660
that

6707
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,050
moment,

6708
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:16,680
you

6709
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:16,770
know,

6710
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,070
almost

6711
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:17,250
10

6712
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:17,550
years

6713
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:17,700
of

6714
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:17,880
you

6715
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,000
know

6716
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,150
how

6717
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,720
clinical

6718
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,590
development

6719
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,010
goes.

6720
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,220
And

6721
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,340
this

6722
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:20,760
is a

6723
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,060
gene

6724
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,600
therapy.

6725
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:21,720
So

6726
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:21,870
you've

6727
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,260
got

6728
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,100
all

6729
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,220
the

6730
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,030
regulations

6731
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:24,210
and

6732
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:24,810
concerns

6733
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:24,900
and

6734
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,050
all

6735
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:25,260
that

6736
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,380
it

6737
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,650
took

6738
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:25,980
almost

6739
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,130
10

6740
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,400
years

6741
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:26,520
to

6742
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:26,700
get

6743
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,880
to

6744
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,270
this

6745
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,570
point,

6746
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:27,810
now

6747
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,050
we're

6748
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,650
living

6749
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,070
human

6750
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,490
being

6751
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:29,880
has a

6752
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,060
new

6753
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,870
functionality

6754
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,020
that

6755
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,470
wasn't

6756
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:31,650
there

6757
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,070
before.

6758
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:32,970
Now,

6759
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:33,390
that's

6760
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,930
incredibly

6761
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,590
inspiring,

6762
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:34,770
you

6763
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,010
know.

6764
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,120
And

6765
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:36,960
it's

6766
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,380
a,

6767
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:37,590
it's

6768
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:37,650
a

6769
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,010
beautiful

6770
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,310
thing.

6771
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:38,430
I

6772
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,580
would

6773
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:38,820
say,

6774
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,060
though,

6775
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,330
that

6776
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,370
the

6777
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,360
broader

6778
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:42,900
significance

6779
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:42,990
of

6780
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,710
optogenetics

6781
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:43,860
is

6782
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,160
really

6783
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,490
still

6784
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,150
understanding,

6785
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,540
because

6786
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,780
once

6787
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:45,870
you

6788
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,680
understand

6789
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:47,550
how

6790
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:47,670
the

6791
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,150
circuitry

6792
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,660
works,

6793
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:48,840
in

6794
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,020
which

6795
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,410
cells

6796
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:49,770
actually

6797
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,220
matter,

6798
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,700
then

6799
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:50,910
any

6800
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,120
kind

6801
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,210
of

6802
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:51,540
treatment

6803
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,230
becomes

6804
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,560
more

6805
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,220
grounded,

6806
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,000
and

6807
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,690
logical

6808
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,110
and

6809
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,830
specific

6810
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:55,950
and

6811
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:56,550
principled.

6812
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,390
And

6813
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:57,630
whether

6814
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:57,750
it's

6815
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,500
medication

6816
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:58,650
or

6817
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:58,950
talk

6818
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,370
therapy,

6819
00:40:59,370 --> 00:40:59,490
or

6820
00:40:59,490 --> 00:40:59,760
brain

6821
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,330
stimulation

6822
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:00,810
treatment

6823
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:01,200
with

6824
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,920
electrical

6825
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,040
or

6826
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,490
magnetic

6827
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:02,970
means,

6828
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,630
if

6829
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:03,810
you

6830
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,200
actually

6831
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,410
know

6832
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:04,560
what

6833
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,130
matters,

6834
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:05,790
that

6835
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:05,940
is

6836
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,390
incredibly

6837
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,780
powerful,

6838
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:06,930
and I

6839
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,290
think,

6840
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,520
no,

6841
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,180
no,

6842
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,390
you

6843
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,690
know,

6844
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,040
not

6845
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,370
intended

6846
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:11,520
to

6847
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,240
disparage

6848
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,540
this

6849
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,350
beautiful

6850
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,160
retinal

6851
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,610
work

6852
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:15,000
and

6853
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,660
conferring,

6854
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:15,900
you

6855
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:15,990
know,

6856
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,290
vision

6857
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,680
on

6858
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,100
someone

6859
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:17,280
who

6860
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,520
couldn't

6861
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:17,760
see,

6862
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:17,850
of

6863
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,120
course,

6864
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,330
that's

6865
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:18,810
wonderful.

6866
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:19,890
But

6867
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,540
that's

6868
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,020
direct,

6869
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,140
what

6870
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,200
you

6871
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,350
might

6872
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:22,530
call

6873
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:22,950
direct

6874
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,610
optogenetics.

6875
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:23,730
And

6876
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,120
patients

6877
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,750
indirect

6878
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,170
is

6879
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,620
everything

6880
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,830
that

6881
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,250
comes

6882
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:26,400
from

6883
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,060
understanding,

6884
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,240
you

6885
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,420
know,

6886
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,720
okay,

6887
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:27,870
we

6888
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,050
know

6889
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,260
these

6890
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,590
cells

6891
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,010
matter

6892
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,400
now,

6893
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,730
for

6894
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:29,910
this

6895
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,300
symptom,

6896
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:30,690
well,

6897
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,320
how

6898
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,500
can

6899
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:31,710
we

6900
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,160
target

6901
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,520
those

6902
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:32,730
those

6903
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:33,060
cells

6904
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,150
and

6905
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,330
help

6906
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:33,450
them

6907
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:33,630
work

6908
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:33,930
better

6909
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:34,080
in

6910
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,650
patients

6911
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:34,920
by

6912
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,070
any

6913
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:35,520
means?

6914
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,790
And I

6915
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,030
think

6916
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,360
that's

6917
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,690
the

6918
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,080
broader

6919
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,650
significance

6920
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:37,740
of

6921
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,400
optogenetics.

6922
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:38,880
Clinically,

6923
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:39,480

6924
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,780

6926
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:40,200
both

6927
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:40,380
on

6928
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,740
well,

6929
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:40,950
and

6930
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:41,700

6934
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,820
incredible,

6935
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,960
big

6936
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:46,650

I

6939
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:47,760
think

6940
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,000
only

6941
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,120

you

6947
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,370
know,

6948
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:50,640
being

6949
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:50,820

and

6954
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,280
the

6955
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,820
suffering

6956
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:53,940

developing

6963
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,660
technologies,

6964
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:57,990
which

6965
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,560
makes

6966
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:58,800

6969
00:41:59,220 --> 00:41:59,760
ask,

6970
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,630
did

6971
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:00,750
you

6972
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,200
decide

6973
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,290
to

6974
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:01,620
become

6975
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:01,650
a

6976
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,610
scientist

6977
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,330
to

6978
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:03,840
cure

6979
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,230

6980
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:04,680
cures

6981
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,160
for

6982
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,610
mental

6983
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,180
disease?

6984
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:08,940
No, I

6985
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,360
didn't.

6986
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:09,840
It's

6987
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:09,990
a

6988
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,200
it's

6989
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:10,230
a

6990
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,440
really

6991
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,800
important

6992
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,220
question

6993
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,340
to

6994
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,670
actually

6995
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:11,850
look

6996
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,150
back

6997
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,840
and

6998
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,110
see

6999
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,260
the

7000
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:13,620
steps

7001
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:13,920
that

7002
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,850
brought

7003
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:15,000
you

7004
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,210
to a

7005
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:15,810
particular

7006
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,470
place.

7007
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,890
And

7008
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:17,670
that

7009
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,790
was

7010
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,180
not

7011
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:18,810
what

7012
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,020
brought

7013
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,320
me

7014
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,010
initially

7015
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:20,130
to

7016
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:20,610
science

7017
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,090
and,

7018
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,330
and

7019
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:21,480
it's

7020
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:21,870
okay

7021
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,110
to, I

7022
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,320
think,

7023
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,440
to

7024
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:22,920
embrace

7025
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,580
the

7026
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:23,880
twists

7027
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,000
and

7028
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,360
turns

7029
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,510
that

7030
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:24,930
life

7031
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:26,340
brings

7032
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:26,670
to

7033
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:26,880
you.

7034
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:27,600
But I

7035
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:27,840
was

7036
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,110
always

7037
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,470
interested

7038
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:28,620
in

7039
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:28,680
the

7040
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:28,980
brain.

7041
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:29,280
And

7042
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:29,760
so

7043
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:30,630
that

7044
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,960
was

7045
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,620
something

7046
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:31,890
that

7047
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,070
for

7048
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,220
me

7049
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,610
started

7050
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:32,850
from

7051
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:33,090
a

7052
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:33,540
very

7053
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:33,840
early

7054
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,380
age,

7055
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:34,590
I

7056
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,070
was,

7057
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,190
you

7058
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,280
know,

7059
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,430
we

7060
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,730
talked

7061
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:35,880
about

7062
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,090
being

7063
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,870
introspective,

7064
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,710
I

7065
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,130
noticed

7066
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:38,370
very

7067
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:38,610
early

7068
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:38,880
on, I

7069
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,330
had a

7070
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:39,930
deep

7071
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,290
love

7072
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:40,560
of

7073
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,490
poetry

7074
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:41,850
and

7075
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:42,780
stories.

7076
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:43,860
And I

7077
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,340
was a

7078
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:44,880
voracious

7079
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,420
reader.

7080
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,640
And I

7081
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,180
was

7082
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,290
amazed

7083
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:49,560
by

7084
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:49,950
how

7085
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,670
words

7086
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,510
could

7087
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:51,990
could

7088
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,170
make

7089
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:52,290
me

7090
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:52,770
feel

7091
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:52,920
in

7092
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,430
particular

7093
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:53,850
ways,

7094
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,180
just

7095
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:54,990
even

7096
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,290
even

7097
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:55,680
separate

7098
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:55,860
from

7099
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,280
their,

7100
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:56,460
you

7101
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:56,640
know,

7102
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,210
of

7103
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:57,450
course,

7104
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:57,930
dictionary

7105
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:58,380
meanings,

7106
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,740
the

7107
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,310
rhythm

7108
00:42:59,340 --> 00:42:59,550
and

7109
00:42:59,550 --> 00:42:59,670
how

7110
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,820
they

7111
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,060
work

7112
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,630
together,

7113
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,410
even

7114
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:01,770
separate

7115
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:01,920
from

7116
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,310
meaning.

7117
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,510
And I

7118
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,960
was

7119
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,530
stunned

7120
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:04,920
by

7121
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,430
poets

7122
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:05,790
that

7123
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,030
could

7124
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,270
use

7125
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:06,600
words

7126
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,690
in

7127
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:06,870
new

7128
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:07,410
ways

7129
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,740
that

7130
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:08,430
were

7131
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:08,940
even

7132
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:09,420
divorced

7133
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:09,600
from

7134
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:09,810
their

7135
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,080
meaning

7136
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,170
at

7137
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:10,440
all,

7138
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:10,590
and

7139
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:10,740
yet

7140
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:10,890
could

7141
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:11,220
still

7142
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:11,550
trigger

7143
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,030
specific

7144
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:12,420
emotions.

7145
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,600
And I

7146
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,020
was,

7147
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:13,590
this

7148
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:13,710
was

7149
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:13,950
always

7150
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,460
fascinating

7151
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:14,550
to

7152
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,700
me.

7153
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,320
So,

7154
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,310
you

7155
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:17,640
know,

7156
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:18,510
I

7157
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:18,780
wanted

7158
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:18,840
to

7159
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,260
understand

7160
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:19,590
that.

7161
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:20,190
And

7162
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:20,400
so I

7163
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:20,550
was

7164
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,940
interested

7165
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,840
in I

7166
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,140
became

7167
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:22,500
interested

7168
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:22,650
in

7169
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:22,740
the

7170
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,190
brain.

7171
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:23,580
And I

7172
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:23,940
thought,

7173
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,300
well,

7174
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:24,480
I'm

7175
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,600
going

7176
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:24,660
to

7177
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:24,780
have

7178
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:24,870
to

7179
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:25,200
study

7180
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,290
the

7181
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:25,590
human

7182
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,070
brain,

7183
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:27,390
because

7184
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:27,900
only

7185
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,620
human

7186
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,190
beings

7187
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,640
can

7188
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,200
describe

7189
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,350
what's

7190
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:31,620
going

7191
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:31,830
on

7192
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,400
inside

7193
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:32,820
and

7194
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,090
off.

7195
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:34,770
So in

7196
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,190
college,

7197
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,400
I

7198
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:35,700
began

7199
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:35,760
to

7200
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,000
steer

7201
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,480
myself

7202
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:36,960
toward

7203
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,040
medicine,

7204
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,060
and

7205
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,270
with

7206
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,360
the

7207
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:39,630
idea

7208
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:39,720
of

7209
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,080
becoming

7210
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,140
a

7211
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:40,830
neurosurgeon.

7212
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,270
And

7213
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,930
so I

7214
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,040
came

7215
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,460
here

7216
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:45,240
to

7217
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,110

7218
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:46,620
school,

7219
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:47,310
and

7220
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:47,430
did

7221
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,760
an MD

7222
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,090

7223
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:48,210

7224
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:48,780
program.

7225
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:50,670
Planning

7226
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,390

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,570

00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:51,720

7230
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,080
through

7231
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:52,230

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:08,520
even

7280
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,000

I was

7284
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,500
sure

7285
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:10,590
I

7286
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:10,830

00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:11,340
And I

7290
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:11,640
loved

7303
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,580
damage.

7304
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:17,670
And

7305
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:17,760
there

7306
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:17,910
was a

7307
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,420
neglect

7308
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,050
syndrome

7309
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:19,260
where

7310
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:19,350
the

7311
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:19,830
patient

7312
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:20,820
was

7313
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,030
not

7314
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,330
able

7315
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:21,780
to be

7316
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,170
aware

7317
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:22,260
of

7318
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,620
something

7319
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:22,740
that

7320
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,160
was

7321
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,150
right

7322
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:24,240
in

7323
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,450
front

7324
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:24,540
of

7325
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:24,780
him,

7326
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:25,050
even

7327
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,170
though

7328
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:25,290
their

7329
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:25,650
vision

7330
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:25,770
was

7331
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,010
broken,

7332
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:26,130
even

7333
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,220
though

7334
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,340
their

7335
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:26,640
vision

7336
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,760
was

7337
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,120
perfectly

7338
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:27,450
fine.

7339
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:27,990
Exactly.

7340
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,130
And

7341
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,370
so I

7342
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:29,730
was

7343
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,300
and I

7344
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:30,630
loved

7345
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:30,690
the

7346
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,200
operating

7347
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:31,470
room.

7348
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:31,560
I

7349
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,100
loved

7350
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,360
the

7351
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,900
rhythm

7352
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,140
of

7353
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,100
suturing

7354
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:35,340
and

7355
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,400
the

7356
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,910
precision

7357
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,270
of it

7358
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,540
and,

7359
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,080
and I

7360
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,350
loved

7361
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:37,470
being

7362
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:37,680
able

7363
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:37,740
to

7364
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:37,950
help

7365
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,370
patients

7366
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:38,910
immediately.

7367
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:40,260
But

7368
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:40,500
then

7369
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:40,800
a

7370
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,490
required

7371
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,840
rotation

7372
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:43,170
was

7373
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:43,320
in

7374
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,070
psychiatry,

7375
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:45,570
which

7376
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:45,780
I was

7377
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,020
not

7378
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,290
looking

7379
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:46,590
forward

7380
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,370
to at

7381
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:47,610
all.

7382
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:49,020
And

7383
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,290
that

7384
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:50,160
completely

7385
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,580
reset

7386
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,060
my

7387
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,240
whole

7388
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:51,570
life

7389
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:51,930
that

7390
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,440
that

7391
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,220
experience

7392
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,340
in

7393
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,000
psychiatry

7394
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,420
and

7395
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,510
it

7396
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:54,870
was

7397
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,020
it

7398
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,140
was

7399
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,350
that

7400
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:55,530
that

7401
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:55,740
that

7402
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,100
moment

7403
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:56,250
that

7404
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:56,610
I saw

7405
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:56,820
this

7406
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:57,330
is

7407
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:58,320
first

7408
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,380
of

7409
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,530
all,

7410
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:58,620
the

7411
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,310
greatest

7412
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,970
need

7413
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,300
And

7414
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:00,900
the

7415
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,230
depth

7416
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:01,350
of

7417
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,890
suffering

7418
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,070
and

7419
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:02,970
the

7420
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,270
depth

7421
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,360
of

7422
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:03,450
the

7423
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:03,900
mystery

7424
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,560
together.

7425
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,510
And

7426
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:06,900
also

7427
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:06,990
it

7428
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,560
was,

7429
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:07,890
I

7430
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:08,100
almost

7431
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,280
feel

7432
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:08,310
a

7433
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:08,490
little

7434
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:08,760
guilty

7435
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:08,970
about

7436
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:09,210
this.

7437
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:09,390
It's

7438
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:09,570
so

7439
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,080
interesting

7440
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,350
to,

7441
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:10,500
you

7442
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,740
know,

7443
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,370
yes,

7444
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:11,640
yes,

7445
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:11,970
there's

7446
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:12,210
Yes,

7447
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:12,330
we

7448
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:12,690
can

7449
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,530
help.

7450
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,130
Yes,

7451
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:14,340
there's

7452
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:14,790
need.

7453
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,150
But

7454
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:15,930
as a

7455
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:16,650
scientist,

7456
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,400
this

7457
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:17,580
is

7458
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,330
amazing

7459
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:18,480
that

7460
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:18,780
someone's

7461
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,380
reality

7462
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:19,650
can

7463
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:19,920
be

7464
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,400
different

7465
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,000
from

7466
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:21,150
my

00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:21,780
you

7469
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:21,930
know,

7470
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,110
with

7471
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,410
with

7472
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,070
everything,

7473
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,360
physically,

7474
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:24,480
as

7475
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,630
far

7476
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:24,810
as we

7477
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:24,990
can

7478
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,410
tell

7479
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:25,500
the

7480
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,040
same

7481
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:26,880
with

7482
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,390
the

7483
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:27,810
measures

7484
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:27,930
we

7485
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:28,410
have.

7486
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,220
And

7487
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:29,430
yet

7488
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:29,610
we've

7489
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:29,790
got a

7490
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,090
different

7491
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,510

7492
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:30,840
that

7493
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,380
is an

00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,130
thing.

7496
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,340
And

7497
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,550
if we

7498
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:32,880
can

7499
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,420
understand

7500
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:33,810
that,

7501
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,140
and

that

7506
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:35,580
would

7507
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:35,880
be

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:52,710
was

7720
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,310
Geneva.

7721
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:54,030
So I

7722
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:54,600
spent

7723
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:54,960
time

7724
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,050
in

7725
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:55,380
Geneva

7726
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:55,680
only

7727
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:55,830
for

7728
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,010
that

7729
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,340
reason,

7730
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:56,520
it's

7731
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:56,790
also

7732
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:57,030
turns

7733
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:57,180
out

7734
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:57,330
to be

7735
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:57,420
an

7736
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:57,900
interesting

7737
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,230
city.

7738
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,780
So

7739
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,170
you

7740
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:01,620
developed

7741
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,490
methods

7742
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:02,940
to

7743
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,660
control

7744
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:04,650
neurons

7745
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,010
with

7746
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:05,550
these

7747
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,300
algae

7748
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,200
proteins

7749
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,250
using

7750
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:08,670
light.

7751
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,470
In

7752
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,340
2015,

7753
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,640
there

7754
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,000
was

7755
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,020
what

7756
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,140
I

7757
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:13,380
thought

7758
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:13,590
was a

7759
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:13,770
very

7760
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:13,980
nice

7761
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,370

7762
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:14,700

7763
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:14,760
in

7764
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:14,820
the

7765
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:14,970
New

7767
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,530
describing

7768
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:16,710

7773
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,210
state

7774
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:18,390
of

7775
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:19,650
your

7778
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:20,490
the

laboratory

7780
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:21,060
in

7781
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:21,120
the

7783
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,170

patient.

7789
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:24,660
So

7790
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:24,810
this,

7791
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,050
as I

7792
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:25,380
recall,

7793
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:25,410
a

who

7796
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,430
was

7797
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,000
severely

7798
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,660
depressed.

7799
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:28,950
And

7800
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:29,190
you

7801
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:29,730
reported

7802
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:29,850

7805
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:30,570
some

7806

of

7807
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:30,720
the

7808

7809
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:31,410
with

7810
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:31,560

7812
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:32,730
and

7813
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:33,060
then

7814
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:33,300

7815
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:33,600
real

00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,230

7817
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,490
increase

7823
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:37,470
called

7844
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,960
What

7845
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,170
is

7846
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:46,410
the

7864
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:56,370
because

7865
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:56,430
I

00:47:56,430 --> 00:47:56,670
believe

00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:57,810

7879
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,270
right?

7880
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:01,170
Or to

let

7898
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:06,840
differently.

7899
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:07,530
In

7901
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:07,800
of

7902
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:07,920
what

7903
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:07,980
we

7904
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,070
were

7905
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,250

My

00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:11,970
is

7914
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:12,240
that

7915
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:12,390
if

7916
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,750
somebody

00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:14,340
they

00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,320
there,

7934
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:20,310
ss ra

7935

whatever,

7941
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,450
that

7942
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,200
sometimes

7943
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:25,440
they

7944
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:25,950
experience

7945
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,370
relief,

7946
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:26,550
but

7947
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:26,700
they're

7948
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,060
often

7949
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,390

00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,140
effects.

7952
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,680
Sometimes

7953
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:28,770
they

7954
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:29,070
don't

7955
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:29,580

7956
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:29,940
relief.

7957
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,270
But

7958
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:31,200
as I

7959
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,620
understand

7960
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:31,890
it,

7967
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:34,230
in

7968
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,980
principle,

7969
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:36,120
would

7970
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,600
allow

00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,140
you

7972
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,160
to

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:38,640
turn

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,330

7975
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:39,660
off

7976
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:39,750
the

7982
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,000
that

7983
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:42,300
lead

7984
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,420
to

7985
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:42,510

7988
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:43,530
Or

7989
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:43,770
maybe

7990
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:43,980
you

7991
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,340
turn

7992
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,490
up a

7995
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,960

8000
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:50,280
Where

8001
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,310
are

8002
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,730
we at

8003
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,300
now

8004
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:51,510
in

8005
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:51,780
terms

8006
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:51,900
of

8007
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,380
bringing

8008
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,530
this

8009
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,400
technology

8010
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,970
to

8011
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:54,390
the

8012
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,690
nervous

8013
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:54,990
system

8014
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,110
and

8015
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:55,290
let's

8016
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:55,560
start

8017
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:55,710
with

8018
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,280
body

8019
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:56,850
and

8020
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:57,060
then

8021
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,300
move

8022
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:57,540
into

8023
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:57,660
the

8024
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,170
skull?

8025
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,220
Yep.

8026
00:48:59,670 --> 00:48:59,910
So

8027
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:00,270
starting

8028
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:00,390
with

8029
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,450
the

8030
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:00,720
body

8031
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:00,870
is a

8032
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,020
good

8033
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:01,440
example

8034
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:01,800
because

8035
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,460
it it

8036
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,900
highlights

8037
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:04,080
the

8038
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:04,710
opportunity

8039
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:04,920
and

8040
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,220
and

8041
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:05,340
how

8042
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:05,610
far

8043
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:05,700
we

8044
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:05,910
have

8045
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:06,000
to

8046
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:06,300
go.

8047
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:06,870
So

8048
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:07,080
let's

8049
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:07,350
take

8050
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:07,500
this

8051
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:07,950
example

8052
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,130

stimulation.

8056
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,930
So

8057
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,020
the

8058
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,380

8060
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:10,980
it's

8061
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,070
the

00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:13,530
it

8071
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:13,770
goes

8072
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,070
down

8073
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,190

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:33,990
the

8136
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,320
brain.

8137
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,400
And

8138
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:35,550
so

8139
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:35,730
this

8140
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:35,910
is

8141
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:36,240
somewhat

8142
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,900
of a

8143
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,620
of a

8144
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,100
of a

8145
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:38,790
superhighway

8146
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:38,940
to

8147
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,030
the

8148
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,300
brain

8149
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,510
then

8150
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:39,570
it

8151
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:39,750
was

8152
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:39,870
the

8153
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:40,290
idea

8154
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:40,440
and

8155
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,040
maybe

8156
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:41,250
the

8157
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:41,550
idea

8158
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:41,670
is

8159
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,880
maybe

8160
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,030
we

8161
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,210
could

8162
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,390
put a

8163
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,750
little

8164
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:43,170
cuff

8165
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:43,260
a

8166
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:43,590
little

8167
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,430
electrical

8168
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:46,560
device

8169
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,040
around

8170
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:47,130
the

8171
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:47,550
vagus

8172
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:47,970
nerve

8173
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:48,630
itself,

8174
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:48,780
and

8175
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,050
maybe

8176
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:49,320
have

8177
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:49,500
just

8178
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:49,650
like

8179
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:49,710
a

8180
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:50,250
pacemaker

8181
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:50,670
battery,

8182
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:50,880
have

8183
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:50,910
a

8184
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:51,180
little

8185
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:51,570
power

8186
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:51,960
source

8187
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,290
here

8188
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:52,500
under

8189
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:52,590
the

8190
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,190
clavicle,

8191
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:53,760
everything

8192
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:53,970
under

8193
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,060
the

8194
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:54,540
skin

8195
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:55,200
and

8196
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,380
have

8197
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,440
a

8198
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:55,920
little

00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:56,580
cuff

8200
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,060
and

8201
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,510
drive

8202
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:57,960
signals

8203
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:58,050
and

8204
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:58,260
maybe

8205
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,410
they'll

8206
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:58,590
get

8207
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:58,860
back

8208
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:58,950
to

8209
00:49:58,950 --> 00:49:59,040
the

8210
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,370
brain.

8211
00:49:59,370 --> 00:49:59,640
So

8212
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,970
way

8213
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,270
Getting

8214
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:00,570
into

8215
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:00,630
the

8216
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,960
brain

8217
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,380
without

8218
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:02,340
putting

8219
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:02,640
something

8220
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,090
physical

8221
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,300
into

8222
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:03,360
the

8223
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:03,660
brain.

8224
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:03,870
And

8225
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,110
why

8226
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:04,230
the

8227
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,740
Vegas?

8228
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:04,860
I

8229
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,010
mean,

8230
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:05,190
it's

8231
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:05,580
there

8232
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:05,790
but

8233
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:05,910
and

8234
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,030
it's

8235
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:06,810
accessible.

8236
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,110
That's

8237
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:07,200
the

8238
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:07,530
reason.

8239
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,040
That's

8240
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:08,130
the

8241
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:08,430
reason.

8242
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:08,550
That's

8243
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:08,640
the

8244
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:08,910
reason.

8245
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:09,150
Yes.

8246
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,660
Really?

8247
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:09,900
Yeah.

8248
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,170
You're

8249
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:10,350
not

8250
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:10,650
kidding.

8251
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:10,890
I'm

8252
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:11,010
not

8253
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:11,310
kidding.

8254
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:11,610
So

8255
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,090
stimulating

8256
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:12,180
the

8257
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,510
Vegas

8258
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:12,630
to

8259
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,990
treat

8260
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,650
depression

8261
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,160
simply

8262
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:14,580
because

8263
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:14,730
it's

8264
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,390
accessible.

8265
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:15,600
It

8266
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,140
started

8267
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,410
as

8268
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:16,740
actually

8269
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,280
as an

8270
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,060
epilepsy

8271
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,440
treatment

8272
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:19,800
and

8273
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,070
can

8274
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,280
help

8275
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:20,400
with

8276
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:20,820
epilepsy.

8277
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,120
But

8278
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:21,960
yes,

8279
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,410
somebody

8280
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:22,950
loves

8281
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,010
a

8282
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:23,520
medicine.

8283
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:23,880
As a

8284
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:24,570
scientist

8285
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:24,960
I got

8286
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,140
this

8287
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,260
is

8288
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:25,470
where

8289
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:25,770
I get

8290
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:25,860
to

8291
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,250
chuckle

8292
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:26,370
and

8293
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:26,460
you

8294
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:26,850
say,

8295
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:27,060
I'm

8296
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,150
in

8297
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:27,210
the

8298
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:27,510
field

8299
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:27,600
of

8300
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,200
medicine,

8301
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:28,470
it

8302
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,710
from

8303
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,950
that

8304
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,820
perspective,

8305
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:30,540
from

8306
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:30,840
from

8307
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:30,930
the

8308
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,560
perspective

8309
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:31,830
of a

8310
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:32,490
scientist

8311
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:32,580
and

8312
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,150
outsider

8313
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:33,300
the

8314
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,600
field

8315
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:33,690
of

8316
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:34,320
medicine

8317
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:34,560
as a

8318
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:34,860
field

8319
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:34,950
that

8320
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:35,220
goes

8321
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,370
in

8322
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:35,520
and

8323
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,000
tickles

8324
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,810
pathways.

8325
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:38,670
Because

8326
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:38,850
they're

8327
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:39,390
there.

8328
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:40,170
It's

8329
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:41,160
I

8330
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,310
don't

8331
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:41,400
know

8332
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:41,640
what

8333
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:41,760
to

8334
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,480
say.

8335
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,810
It's

8336
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:43,650
a

8337
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:43,950
little

8338
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:44,550
shocking.

8339
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:44,820
Yeah.

8340
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,250
And

8341
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,480
we'll

8342
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:48,660
at

8343
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:48,900
least

8344
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,110
in my

8345
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:49,950
laboratory,

8346
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:50,280
I

8347
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:50,580
always

8348
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,030
say

8349
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:51,270
you

8350
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,540
never

8351
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:51,750
do an

8352
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:52,200
experiment

8353
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,440
because

8354
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:52,530
you

8355
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,010
can

8356
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,640
you

8357
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:53,910
do an

8358
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,330
experiment

8359
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:54,420
to

8360
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,720
test

8361
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:54,780
a

8362
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,230
specific

8363
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,040
hypothesis.

8364
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,220
Yeah.

8365
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:56,610
Yeah.

8366
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:57,420
I

8367
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:57,630
mean,

8368
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:57,870
we

8369
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,170
there

8370
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,290
are,

8371
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:58,500
there

8372
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,530
are

8373
00:50:58,530 --> 00:50:58,950
stories

8374
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:59,280
people

8375
00:50:59,280 --> 00:50:59,610
tell

8376
00:50:59,610 --> 00:50:59,760
so

8377
00:50:59,760 --> 00:50:59,970
that

8378
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:00,060
the

8379
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:00,420
salt

8380
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,140
the

8381
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:01,560
vagus

8382
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,190
nerve

8383
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,030
lands

8384
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,180
on a

8385
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:03,600
particular

8386
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:03,900
spot

8387
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:03,960
in

8388
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,020
the

8389
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:04,320
brain

8390
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,530
called

8391
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:04,590
the

8392
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:05,130
solitary

8393
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:05,460
tract

8394
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:05,940
nucleus,

8395
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:06,120
which

8396
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,210
is

8397
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:06,450
just

8398
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:06,660
one

8399
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,080
synapse

8400
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:07,440
away

8401
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:07,890
from

8402
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:08,490
the

8403
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:09,300
serotonin

8404
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:09,420
and

8405
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:09,930
dopamine

8406
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:10,020
and

8407
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:10,710
norepinephrine.

8408
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:10,830
So

8409
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,010
there's

8410
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:11,070
a

8411
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:11,400
link

8412
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,760
to

8413
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,420
chemical

8414
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:12,840
systems

8415
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:12,930
of

8416
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:12,990
the

8417
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:13,290
brain

8418
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:13,440
that

8419
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:13,650
make

8420
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:13,800
it a

8421
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,310
rational

8422
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:14,610
choice.

8423
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:14,940
Yes,

8424
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:15,090
it's

8425
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:15,360
not

8426
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,480
it's

8427
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:15,690
not

8428
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:16,200
irrational.

8429
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:16,410
But I

8430
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:16,560
can

8431
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,740
tell

8432
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:16,830
you

8433
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:17,130
that,

8434
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:17,580
even

8435
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:17,700
if

8436
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,120
that

8437
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:18,780
were

8438
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:18,990
not

8439
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:19,350
true,

8440
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,470
the

8441
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:19,740
same

8442
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:19,890
thing

8443
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:20,040
would

8444
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,100
have

8445
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,250
been

8446
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:20,610
tried.

8447
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:20,850
Yeah.

8448
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:21,960
You

8449
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,140
got

8450
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,230
you

8451
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:22,350
would

8452
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:22,440
have

8453
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:22,590
done

8454
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:22,710
it

8455
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:23,040
because

8456
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,190
it's

8457
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,760
accessible.

8458
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:23,970
Yeah.

8459
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,240
See?

8460
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:24,750
Okay.

8461
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,320
And,

8462
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:25,590
and

8463
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:25,800
but

8464
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,250
and,

8465
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:26,490
and

8466
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:26,880
why?

8467
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:27,180
Well,

8468
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:27,330
it's,

8469
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,840
it's

8470
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:28,320
not

8471
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:28,680
again,

8472
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:28,860
not

8473
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:28,950
to

8474
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:29,640
disparage

8475
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,750
what's

8476
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,170
been

8477
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:31,950
happening

8478
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:32,070
in

8479
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:32,310
this

8480
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,760
branch

8481
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:32,820
of

8482
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,210
medicine.

8483
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,290
There's

8484
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,800
immense

8485
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:35,490
suffering

8486
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,150
treatments,

8487
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,420
many

8488
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:36,810
treatments

8489
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:37,020
don't

8490
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,350
work.

8491
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:37,830
And

8492
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,490
and

8493
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:39,240
we

8494
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:39,450
try

8495
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:39,780
things

8496
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,080
and

8497
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:40,290
and

8498
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:40,440
this

8499
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,590
is

8500
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:40,980
how

8501
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:41,490
so

8502
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:41,700
many

8503
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,150
advances

8504
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:42,270
in

8505
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:42,630
medicine

8506
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,020
happened.

8507
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,080
You

8508
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:43,260
think

8509
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,590
about

8510
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,040
kidney

8511
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,640
dialysis,

8512
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:44,790
which

8513
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:44,910
has

8514
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:45,090
kept

8515
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:45,300
many

8516
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:45,540
people

8517
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:45,900
alive?

8518
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:46,950
That

8519
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:47,100
that

8520
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,220
was

8521
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:47,400
just

8522
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:47,760
started

8523
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:47,910
by

8524
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,180
someone

8525
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:48,390
saying,

8526
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:48,540
hey,

8527
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:48,930
let's

8528
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:49,260
let's

8529
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:49,560
try

8530
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:49,740
this.

8531
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:49,980
Maybe

8532
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,160
there's

8533
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,550
something

8534
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:50,880
building

8535
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,150
up in

8536
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:51,240
the

8537
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,510
blood?

8538
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:51,720
Maybe

8539
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:51,810
we

8540
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,110
can

8541
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,650
dialyze

8542
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,010
something

8543
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:53,100
and

8544
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:53,280
help

8545
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:53,430
them

8546
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,730
yeah,

8547
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:53,850
it

8548
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:54,180
worked.

8549
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,660
And

8550
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:54,750
it

8551
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:54,870
was

8552
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:55,050
just

8553
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,230
sort

8554
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:55,380
of a

8555
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:55,620
test

8556
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:55,920
pilot

8557
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,550
mentality.

8558
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:57,690
We

8559
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:57,930
can

8560
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:58,140
we

8561
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:58,290
can

8562
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:58,680
access

8563
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:58,770
the

8564
00:51:58,770 --> 00:51:59,160
blood.

8565
00:51:59,670 --> 00:51:59,940
Let's

8566
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,150
run

8567
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:00,240
it

8568
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:00,690
across

8569
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:00,780
a

8570
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,320
dialysis

8571
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,740
membrane,

8572
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:01,890
put

8573
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:01,950
it

8574
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:02,160
back

8575
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,250
in

8576
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:02,310
the

8577
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:02,610
body.

8578
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:02,760
Oh,

8579
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:02,880
my

8580
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,180
God,

8581
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:03,300
that

8582
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:03,570
actually

8583
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:03,840
works.

8584
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:04,500
And

8585
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,070
sometimes

8586
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:05,130
you

8587
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,280
do

8588
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:05,460
need

8589
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:05,790
that

8590
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,090
that

8591
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:06,330
test

8592
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:06,570
pilot

8593
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:06,930
mentality,

8594
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:07,020
of

8595
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,380
course,

8596
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:07,680
to do

8597
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:07,920
it in

8598
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,430
a in

8599
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:08,580
a

8600
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,150
rigorous,

8601
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:09,510
safe

8602
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,960
controlled

8603
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,140
way,

8604
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:10,320
which

8605
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:10,440
is

8606
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:10,560
what

8607
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:10,680
we

8608
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:10,920
do.

8609
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,070
And

8610
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:11,460
so

8611
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:12,660
anyway,

8612
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:12,870
that's

8613
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:13,020
how

8614
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:13,440
we we

8615
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:13,650
ended

8616
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:13,920
up

8617
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,460
with

8618
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:14,790
but

8619
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,970
but

8620
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:15,330
still

8621
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:15,510
with

8622
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:15,600
the

8623
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:15,930

8624
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,140

8625
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:16,620
stimulation.

8626
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:16,890
Okay,

8627
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:17,040
so

8628
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:17,220
what

8629
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,340
is

8630
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,550
it?

8631
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,000
Does

8632
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:18,090
it

8633
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:18,570
work?

8634
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:19,950
It

8635
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:20,400
has

8636
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:20,610
it's

stimulation,

8645
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:24,360
but

8646
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,540
on

8647
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:24,600
the

8648

8650
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:25,680
if

8651
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:25,800
you

8652
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,160
average

8653
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,790

all

8655
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,140

8656
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,320
the

8659
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,130
are

8660
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:29,400
pretty

8661
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,880
small.

8662
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,020
Some

8663
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,410
patients

8664
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:31,500
it

8665
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,650
has

8666
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:31,740
an

00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,130
amazing

00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:32,520
effect.

8669
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:32,790
And

8670
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:33,870
but

8671
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:34,080
some

8672
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,440

8673
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:34,530
that

8674
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:34,830
doesn't

8675
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,070
work

8676
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:35,160
at

8677
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,550
all

8678
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:35,940
and

8679
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:36,450
average

8680
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:36,780
across

8681
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,200
everybody,

8682
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:37,260
the

8683
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:37,530
effect

8684
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:37,800
size

8685
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:37,860
is

8686
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,070
pretty

8687
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:38,430
small.

8688
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,640
How

8689
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:38,700
do

8690
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:38,760
you

8691
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:38,910
think

8692
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:39,060
it's

8693
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:39,360
working?

8694
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,510
When

8695
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,600
it

8696
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:39,810
does

8697
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:39,990
work?

8698
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,230
Is it

8699
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:40,620
triggering

8700
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:40,740
the

8701
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,400
activation

8702
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:41,670
of

8703
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:42,450
neurons

8704
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:42,570
that

8705
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:42,900
release

8706
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,110
more

8707
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,740
serotonin

8708
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:43,830
or

8709
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,280
dopamine?

8710
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:44,610
It

8711
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:44,820
could

8712
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,150
be,

8713
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:45,750
but I

8714
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,900
would

8715
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,110
say

8716
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:46,230
we

8717
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:46,410
don't

8718
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:46,680
have

8719
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,100
evidence

8720
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:47,580
for

8721
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:47,880
that.

8722
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,360
And

8723
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,320
so I

8724
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:49,530
just

8725
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:49,710
don't

8726
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:49,950
know.

8727
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:50,910
But

8728
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:51,570
what

8729
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:51,720
is

8730
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:51,990
clear

8731
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,080
is

8732
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,230
that

8733
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,380
it's

8734
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,740
dose

8735
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,280
limited.

8736
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,420
In

8737
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,750
how

8738
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,200
high

8739
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:55,410
and

8740
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:55,860
strongly

8741
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:55,950
we

8742
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:56,100
can

8743
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,610
stimulate

8744
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:56,880
and

8745
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,300
why

8746
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:57,480
it's

8747
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,840
because

8748
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:57,960
it's

8749
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,050
an

8750
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:58,770
electrode,

8751
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,130
and

8752
00:52:59,130 --> 00:52:59,250
it's

8753
00:52:59,250 --> 00:52:59,700
stimulating

8754
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,180
everything

8755
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,720
nearby.

8756
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:01,860
And

8757
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,010
when

8758
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:02,190

00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:11,640
even

8786
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,820
some

8788
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:12,600
breathing,

8789
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:13,260
because

8790
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,740
everything

8791
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:13,860
in

8792
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:13,920
the

8794
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:14,670
every

8795
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,180

8798
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:16,710
and

8799
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,520
projection

8800
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:17,730
in

8801
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:17,790
the

8802
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,000
neck

8803
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,120
is

8804
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:18,540
being

8805
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,320
affected

8806
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,470
by

8807
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:19,650
this

8808
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:20,100
electrode.

8809
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:20,190
And

8810
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:20,280
so

8811
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,430
you

8812
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:20,610
can

8813
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,090
go up

8814
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,750
just

8815
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,050
so

8816
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:22,590
far

8817
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:22,830
with

8818
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,070
the

8820
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:24,210
and

8821
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:24,300
then

8822
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,390
you

8823
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,540
have

8824
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:24,630

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:25,020
stop.

8826
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,190
So,

8827
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:26,400
you

8828
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,700

8839
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,350
like

8840
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,100
optogenetics

8841
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,370
help

8842
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:32,460
in

8843
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:32,550
the

8844
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:32,940
setting?

8845
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:33,600
In

8846
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:33,990

8847
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,080
it

8848
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,380
could

8849
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,100
because

8850
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,520
that

8851
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:35,640
would

8852
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:35,880
if

8853
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:35,970
you

8854
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:36,180
would

8855
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,660
target

8856
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:36,780

8866
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,490
Let's

8867
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:41,940
say

8877
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:44,250
that

8878
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:44,370
you

8879
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,940
know,

8880
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,690

kind,

8886
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:47,640
then

8887
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:47,790
you're

8888
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:47,880

8890
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:48,360
you

8891
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:48,750
can

8892
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,080
have

00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,260
that

8894
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:49,380
be

8895
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,500
the

8896
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:49,830
only

8897
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,160

8898
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,370
that's

8899
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:50,610
light

8900
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,150
sensitive,

8901
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:51,630
you're

8902
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:51,780
not

8903
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:51,930
gonna

8904
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:52,230
affect

8905
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,470
any

8907
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:52,770
the

00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:52,980
other

8910
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:53,700
the

through.

8918
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:57,630
So

8919
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:57,900
that's

8920
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:57,960
the

8921
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,260
hope

8922
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,440
that's

8923
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:58,530
the

8924
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:58,920
opportunity.

8925
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,010
The

8926
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,520
problem

8927
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:00,570
is

8928
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:00,690
that

8929
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:00,810
we

8930
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:01,050
don't

8931
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:01,200
yet

8932
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,500
have

8933
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:01,680
that

8934
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:01,950
level

8935
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:02,070
of

8936
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:02,550

8938
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,030
We

8939
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:03,240
don't

8940
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,840
know.

8941
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,680
Okay,

8942
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:04,980
it's

8943
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:05,070
the

8944
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:05,340
cell

8945
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:05,790
starting

8946
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:06,120

8947
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,270

00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,260
B

8952
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:07,770
that

8953
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,280
really

8954
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,460
use

8955
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,610
this

8956
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,060
particular

8957
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,270
so we

8958
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,450
want

8959
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:09,510
to

8960
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:09,750

8961
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:09,990
this

8962
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:10,200

piano.

8966
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:11,880
And

8967
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:12,150
then

8968
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:12,570
I see

8969
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:12,810
two

8970
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:13,440
other

8971
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,340
steps

8972
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:14,460
that

8973
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:14,520
are

8974
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:14,970
required.

8975
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:15,240
One

8976
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:15,480
is to

8977
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:15,630
get

8978
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:15,720
the

8979
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,050
channel

8980
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,380
opsin

8981
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:16,680
gene

8982
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:16,950
into

8983
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,040
the

8984
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,490
cell

8985
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:17,760
in

8986
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:17,820
the

8987
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:18,060
case

8988
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,150
of

8989
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,690
Baton

8990
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,110
Rosco

8991
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:19,230
and

8992
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:19,740
colleagues

8993
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:20,550
rescuing

8994
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:20,880
vision

8995
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,000
in

8996
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,120
this

8997
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,630
patient.

8998
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:23,580
They

8999
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:23,730
did

9000
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:23,880
that

9001
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,210
by an

9002
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:24,660
injection

9003
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:24,840
of a

9004
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,530
virus

9005
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:25,740
that

9006
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,070
doesn't

9007
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:26,670
damage

9008
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:26,850
the

9009
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,570
neurons.

9010
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:27,750
The

9011
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,050
virus

9012
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,350
itself

9013
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:28,470
is

9014
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,770
fairly

9015
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:29,460
innocuous,

9016
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,570
but

9017
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:30,870
carries

9018
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:30,930
a

9019
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,620
cargo

9020
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:31,950
and

9021
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:32,070
it's

9022
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:32,310
a one

9023
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:32,520
time

9024
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,090
injection

9025
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,210
the

9026
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:33,480
cells

9027
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,080
Express

9028
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:34,260
and

9029
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:34,500
then

9030
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:34,770
they

9031
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,370
use

9032
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:35,640
light

9033
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,790
to

9034
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,330
stimulate.

9035
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:36,660
So

9036
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:37,830
let's

9037
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:38,370
say

9038
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,180
I'm

9039
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,930
depressed,

9040
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,440
which

9041
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:40,500
I

9042
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:40,680
don't

9043
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:40,860
think

9044
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,160
I am

9045
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:41,340
although

9046
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,490
now

9047
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:41,730
sitting

9048
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:41,820
in

9049
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,000
front

9050
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,090
of a

9051
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,840
psychiatrist,

9052
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,110
you

9053
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:43,500
probably

9054
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,710
can

9055
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:43,890
see

9056
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:44,250
signs

9057
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:44,370
that

9058
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:44,640
maybe

9059
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:44,940
I am

9060
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,000
or

9061
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,210
maybe

9062
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:45,330
I'm

9063
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:45,690
not,

9064
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,440
but

9065
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:47,190
let's

9066
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,280
say

9067
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:47,460
we

9068
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:47,820
put

9069
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,240
gentle

9070
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:48,630
opsin

9071
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:49,230
into

9072
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,100
my a

9073
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:50,730
specific

9074
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,060
branch

9075
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,120
of

9076
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,210
the

9077
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:51,810
Vegas

9078
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,050
that

9079
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:52,290
we

9080
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,250
understand

9081
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,270
is

9082
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,020
responsible

9083
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,170
for

9084
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:55,680
mood.

9085
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:56,790
How

9086
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:56,820
are

9087
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:56,910
we

9088
00:54:56,910 --> 00:54:57,060
going

9089
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:57,120
to

9090
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:57,270
get

9091
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,510
it in

9092
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,930
there?

9093
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:58,830
And

9094
00:54:58,860 --> 00:54:59,070
then

9095
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,220
how

9096
00:54:59,220 --> 00:54:59,280
are

9097
00:54:59,280 --> 00:54:59,370
we

9098
00:54:59,370 --> 00:54:59,490
going

9099
00:54:59,490 --> 00:54:59,580
to

9100
00:54:59,580 --> 00:54:59,910
deliver

9101
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:00,000
the

9102
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,330
Light

9103
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:00,510
because

9104
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:00,600
we're

9105
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:00,750
not

9106
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:00,900
talking

9107
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,080
about

9108
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,740
sunlight

9109
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,010
or

9110
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:02,310
standing

9111
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,430
in

9112
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:02,580
front

9113
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:02,730
of a

9114
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:02,910
light

9115
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,060
bulb

9116
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:03,900
necessarily.

9117
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,410
But

9118
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:04,770
what

9119
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:04,920
are

9120
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:05,160
what

9121
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,190
are

9122
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,280
the

9123
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,060
mechanisms

9124
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:06,330
for

9125
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:06,450
the

9126
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:06,960
body?

9127
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,260
Yeah.

9128
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:07,980
So we

9129
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,130
had

9130
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,190
to

9131
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:08,550
solve

9132
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,000
exactly

9133
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:09,180
these

9134
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:09,600
questions,

9135
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:09,690
you're

9136
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:09,960
saying,

9137
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,110
how

9138
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:10,170
do

9139
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:10,260
you

9140
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:10,440
get

9141
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:10,530
the

9142
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:10,770
light?

9143
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:10,920
And

9144
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:11,070
how

9145
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,130
do

9146
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:11,190
you

9147
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,370
get

9148
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:11,460
the

9149
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:11,790
gene

9150
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,030
in,

9151
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:12,990
in a

9152
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:13,350
in a

9153
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,070
potent

9154
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,430
and

9155
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,030
robust

9156
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,150
and

9157
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:15,450
safe

9158
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:15,720
way.

9159
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,190
And

9160
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:17,820
if

9161
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,180
that's

9162
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,570
now

9163
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,020
solved,

9164
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:19,110
and

9165
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:19,320
that's

9166
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,220
not a

9167
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:20,760
challenge,

9168
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,090
so

9169
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:21,240
there

9170
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:21,360
are

9171
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,960
very

9172
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,470
safe,

9173
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:22,770

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,480
right.

9383
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,170
And

9384
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:43,290
so

9385
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:43,530
that's

9386
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:43,650
the

9387
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:44,070
gene,

9388
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:45,630
then

9389
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:45,750
the

9390
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,990

9392
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:46,560
this

9393
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:46,680
is

9394
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:46,890
also

9395
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:47,280
something

9396
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,880
that

9397
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:48,270
we've

9398
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:48,540
worked

9399
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:48,660
out,

9400
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:48,810
we

9401
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,050
worked

9402
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:49,170
on

9403
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:49,530
making

9404
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:49,950
very,

9405
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,250
very

9406
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:50,610

9407
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,270
sensitive

9408
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:51,960
options.

9409
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:52,800
One

9410
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,460
challenge

9411
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,180
and

9412
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:55,200
botond

9413
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:55,980
would

9414
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,130
be

9415
00:56:56,130 --> 00:56:56,460
the

9416
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:56,940

9418
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:57,330
state

9419
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:57,510
this,

9420
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,600
in

9421
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:57,930
fact,

9422
00:56:57,930 --> 00:56:58,290
in

9423
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:58,650
solving

9424
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:58,950
this

9425
00:56:59,190 --> 00:56:59,550
problem

9426
00:56:59,550 --> 00:56:59,670

patient,

9429
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,240
he

9430
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,390
had

9431
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,480
to

9432
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:00,960

9433
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:02,730
goggles

9434
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:03,090
that

9435
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:04,290
created

9436
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:04,530
much

9437
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:04,860

9438
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:05,160
much

9439
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:05,520
brighter

9440
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:05,820

9441
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:06,270

9446
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,450
Because,

9447
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:09,810
as I

9448
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:10,170
mentioned

9449
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:10,590
earlier,

9450
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:10,770
you

9451
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:10,920
have

9452
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,010
to

9453
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:11,310
pack

9454
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:11,850
a lot

9455
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:11,940

9460
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,070
they

9461
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:14,250
don't

9462
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:14,370
have

9463
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:14,610
much

9464
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,030
current,

9465
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:15,780
you

9466
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:15,900
have

9467
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:15,990

00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,380
really

9469
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,590

9470
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:17,190
sure

9471
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,370
that

9472
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:17,490
you've

9473
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:17,820
got

9475
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:18,510

9477
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:19,710

00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,130
activate

9479
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:20,370
enough

9480
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:20,460

9481
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:20,670
them

9482
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:20,760
to

9483
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,120
cause

9484
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,180
a

stimulation,

9486
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:21,840
and

9487
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:21,900
it

9488
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,050
has

9489
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,230

9490
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,320
the

9493
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,280
has

9494
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:23,400
to be

9495
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:23,460
the

9496
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:23,610
right

9497
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:23,730
one

9498
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:23,970
going

9499
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:24,240
back

9500
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,300
to

9501
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:24,390
your

9502
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:24,840
example

9503
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:24,930
of

9504
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:25,050
the

9505
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:25,440
algae

9506
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:25,770
moving

9507
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:26,190
toward

9508
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:26,370

00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:26,910
away

9510
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:28,050

9512
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,890
it

9513
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:29,100
has

9514
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,280

right.

9518
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,360
So

9519
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:30,540
could

9520
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:30,750

9590
00:57:58,890 --> 00:57:59,010
so

9591
00:57:59,010 --> 00:57:59,100
we're

9592
00:57:59,100 --> 00:57:59,460
talking

9593
00:57:59,460 --> 00:57:59,850
about

9594
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,120
a

9595
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:00,600
little

9596
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,290
tiny

9597
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,130
stamp.

9598
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:03,900
That's

9599
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,430
basically

9600
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:06,690
half

9601
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:06,720
a

9602
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,440
millimeter

9603
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:07,560
in

9604
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,070
size,

9605
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:09,330
all

9606
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:09,780
around

9607
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:10,650
each

9608
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:10,890
edge,

9609
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,160
half

9610
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,220
a

9611
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:11,640
millimeter

9612
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:11,730
in

9613
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,000
size.

9614
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,690
I can

9615
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:13,110
imagine

9616
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:13,350
that

9617
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:13,560
being

9618
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:13,740
put

9619
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:13,980
under

9620
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:14,130
my

9621
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:14,640
skin,

9622
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,120
and

9623
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:15,300
then

9624
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:15,390
I

9625
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:15,660
would

9626
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:15,990
what

9627
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,620
I had

9628
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:16,710
an

9629
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,980
app

9630
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:17,220
on my

9631
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:17,580
phone

9632
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:17,700
and

9633
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:17,820
I'd

9634
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,270
say,

9635
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:18,750
I'd

9636
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,020
say

9637
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,500
Dr.

9638
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:19,860
dicer

9639
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,220
off.

9640
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:20,700
I'm

9641
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:20,880
not

9642
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,180
feeling

9643
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:21,420
great

9644
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:21,870
today.

9645
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,560
Can I

9646
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:22,950
increase

9647
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:23,040
the

9648
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,700
stimulation

9649
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:23,790
and

9650
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:23,910
you

9651
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,090
say

9652
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:24,300
go

9653
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:24,570
for

9654
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:24,720
it,

9655
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:24,930
and

9656
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:25,080
then

9657
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,140
I

9658
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:25,410
ramp

9659
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:25,500
it

9660
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:25,680
up?

9661
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:25,830
Is

9662
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:25,950
that

9663
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,220
how

9664
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:26,280
we

9665
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,610
go? I

9666
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:26,730
mean,

9667
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:26,910
that's

9668
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:27,360
effectively

9669
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,450
what

9670
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:27,570
we

9671
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:27,900
already

9672
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,230
do

9673
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:28,440

9683
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:31,530

I say

9702
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,240
how I

9703
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:36,390
would

9704
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:36,540
go

9708
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:37,980
I use

And

9718
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:41,490
then

9719
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:41,550
I

9720
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:41,790

9756
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,500
Yeah,

00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:08,700
dose.

9798
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:09,150
So

9799
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:09,300
this

9800
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,420
is

9801
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:09,810
happening.

9802
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:10,080
Now.

9803
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:10,260
This

9804
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,320
is

9805
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,500
happening

9806
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:10,620
right

9807
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:10,800
now

9808
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,280
electrically,

9809
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:11,430
you

9810
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,610
do

9811
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:11,790
this

9812
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,210
routinely,

9813
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:12,450
I do

9814
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:12,870
routinely

9815
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,050
in my

9816
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:13,380
clinic

9817
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,040
electrically,

9818
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:14,280
and

9819
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:14,460
you're

9820
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,000
getting

9821
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:15,870
the

9822
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:16,620
verbal

9823
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,160
content,

9824
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,670
which

9825
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:17,940
as

9826
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,030
you

9827
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:18,780
described

9828
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,530
earlier,

9829
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,070
is

9830
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,400
the

9831
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:20,910
indication

9832
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:21,000
of

9833
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,210
how

9834
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:21,480
well

9835
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:21,780
something

9836
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:21,900
is

9837
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,230
working

9838
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,380
in

9839
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:22,650
real

9840
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,010
time.

9841
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:23,610
So

9842
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:23,790
this

9843
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:23,940
what

9844
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,150
maybe

9845
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:24,210
you

9846
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:24,300
could

9847
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,480
just

9848
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:24,900
describe

9849
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:24,930
a

9850
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:25,140
little

9851
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:25,320
bit

9852
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:25,440
of

9853
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:25,590
the

9854
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:26,130
interaction

9855
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:26,280
with

9856
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:26,490
that

9857
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:26,910
particular

9858
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:27,240
patient

9859
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,660
or

9860
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:27,960
another

9861
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,320
patient.

9862
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:28,650
What's

9863
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:28,710
a

9864
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,250
typical

9865
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:29,790
arc

9866
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:30,480
of

9867
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,010
narrative,

9868
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:32,760
as

9869
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,090
you

9870
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:33,360
go

9871
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:33,600
from

9872
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:33,780
no

9873
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,560
stimulation

9874
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:34,950
to

9875
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,400
increase

9876
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,090
stimulation,

9877
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,330
in

9878
00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:36,690
most

9879
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,870
in

9880
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:37,080
most

9881
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:37,650
patients,

9882
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:38,130
the

9883
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:38,520
actual

9884
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,150
therapeutic

9885
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:39,540
effects,

9886
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:39,660
the

9887
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,260
benefits

9888
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:40,650
actually

9889
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,130
take

9890
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,000
many

9891
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,300
days

9892
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:42,420
to

9893
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:42,870
weeks.

9894
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:43,470
And

9895
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:43,590
so

9896
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:43,710
what

9897
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:43,860
I'm

9898
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,250
mostly

9899
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:44,760
focusing

9900
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:45,870
on in

9901
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:45,960
the

9902
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,590
office

9903
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:46,800
in

9904
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,010
real

9905
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:47,280
time

9906
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:47,700
is

9907
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,060
making

9908
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,450
sure

9909
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:48,600
I'm

9910
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:48,780
in a

9911
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,230
safe,

9912
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:49,650
low

9913
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:49,980
side

9914
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,400

9915
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,060
regime.

9916
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:51,660
And

9917
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:51,780
so

9918
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:52,050
first

9919
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:52,140
I

9920
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:52,350
talk

9921
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:52,410
to

9922
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:52,500
the

9923
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:52,830
patient,

9924
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:52,890
you

9925
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:52,980
know,

9926
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,370
how

9927
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:53,820
who

9928
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:53,940
has

9929
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,090
been

9930
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:54,270
on a

9931
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:54,780
particular

9932
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,260
dose

9933
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:55,500
of

9934
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:55,620
the

9935
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,220
stimulation

9936
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:56,610
for

9937
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,000
weeks

9938
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,780
or

9939
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:58,200
longer

9940
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,610
and I

9941
00:59:59,610 --> 00:59:59,880
talked

9942
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:00,000
about

9943
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,540
symptoms,

9944
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:00,690
how

9945
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:00,870
were

9946
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:01,230
things

9947
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:01,410
over

9948
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:01,500
the

9949
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,130
past

9950
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:02,730
month?

9951
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:02,910
How

9952
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:03,030
is

9953
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,180
your

9954
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,510
hope?

9955
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,690
How

9956
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:03,810
is

9957
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:03,930
your

9958
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:04,230
energy

9959
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:04,740
level

9960
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,520
asleep?

9961
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:05,940
You

9962
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,030
know,

9963
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:06,180
how

9964
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:06,330
what

9965
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:06,420
is

9966
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:06,540
your

9967
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:06,900
mood.

9968
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,430
And

9969
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:08,580
then

9970
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:08,700
we

9971
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:08,970
talked

9972
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:09,060
with

9973
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,120
the

9974
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,540
patient

9975
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:09,630
we

9976
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,080
decide

9977
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:10,350
this

9978
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:10,620
is

9979
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:10,830
this

9980
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:10,920
is

9981
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,130
not

9982
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:11,340
yet

9983
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:11,490
where

9984
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:11,610
we'd

9985
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:11,820
like

9986
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:11,910
to

9987
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:12,240
be.

9988
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,420
And

9989
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:12,570
so

9990
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:12,990
then

9991
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:13,890
I can

9992
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:14,130
turn

9993
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:14,310
up

9994
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:14,640
the

9995
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:15,180
intensity

9996
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:15,240
of

9997
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:15,300
the

9998
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:15,780
stimulation,

9999
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:15,990
real

10000
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,260
time

10001
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,350
in

10002
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:16,440
the

10003
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:16,740
office,

10004
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:16,860

Okay,

01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,210
then,

10084
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:42,360

10085
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:42,450

safe.

10094
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,080
And

10095
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,410
then

10166
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:16,680
Otherwise,

01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:19,860
how

10178
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,100
to

10179
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:20,940
maneuver

10180
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:21,240
them

10181
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:22,050

manipulate

10183
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:22,710

10186
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:23,400
for

10191
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:24,900
But

10192
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:27,180
what

10197
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,220
So as

10198
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:29,280
a

I

10202
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:30,810

10205
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:31,500

10206
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,070
dilating

10207
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:32,250
is a

10208
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:32,520
sign

10209
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:32,610
of

10210
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:33,150
arousal.

10211
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:33,330
But

10212
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:33,450
that

10213
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:33,600
could

10214
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:33,780
be a

10215
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:34,380
positive

10216
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:34,830
arousal

10217
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:35,190
positive

10218
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:35,730
valence

10219
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,030
like

10220
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:36,660
excitement,

10221
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:36,960
or it

10222
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,110
could

10223
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:37,440
be

10224
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,070
terror,

10225
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,520
you're

10226
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:38,670
gonna

10227
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:38,790
get

10228
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:38,850
the

10229
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:39,240
same

10230
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,780
dilation

10231
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:39,870
of

10232
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:39,930
the

10233
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,380
pupils.

10234
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,050
And

10235
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:43,140
I'm

10236
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:43,380
always

10237
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:43,710
reminding

10238
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:43,920
people

10239
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,010
that

10240
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:44,190
these

10241
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:44,370
two

10242
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:44,550
little

10243
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:44,880
goodies

10244
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,030
are

10245
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,180
two

10246
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:45,480
pieces

10247
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:45,570
of

10248
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:45,900
brain

10249
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:46,410
basically,

10250
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:46,530
they're

10251
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:46,740
just

10252
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:47,100
outside

10253
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:47,160
the

10254
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:47,550
cranial

10255
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:47,910
vault.

10256
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,180
So

10257
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:48,300
they're

10258
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:48,510
not

10259
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:48,840
unlike

10260
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:48,930
the

10261
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:49,290
Vegas

10262
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:49,380
in

10263
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:49,560
that

10264
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:49,800
sense,

10265
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:49,920
but

10266
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,070
they're

10267
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:50,280
more

10268
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,430
of a

10269
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:51,090
report

10270
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:51,570
than

10271
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:51,630
a

10272
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:52,020
control

10273
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:52,320
knob,

10274
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:52,740
although

10275
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:53,340
I

10276
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:53,550
like

10277
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:53,640
to

10278
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:53,820
think

10279
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:53,940
they

10280
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:54,120
could

10281
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,420
be

10282
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:54,750
used

10283
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:54,840
as

10284
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,200
control

10285
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:55,500
knobs

10286
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:55,710
to.

10287
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:57,810
So

10288
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:58,410
without

10289
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:58,620
putting

10290
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:58,710
you

10291
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,860
on

10292
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:58,920
the

10293
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,550
spot,

10294
01:01:59,610 --> 01:01:59,880
again,

10295
01:01:59,880 --> 01:01:59,970
to

10296
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:00,540
diagnose

10297
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:00,960
me,

10298
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:01,440
not

10299
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:01,680
something

10300
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:01,740
I

10301
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:01,890
would

10302
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,130
never

10303
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:02,370
ask

10304
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:02,460
you

10305
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:02,850
to do

10306
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,540
with

10307
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:03,600
the

10308
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:03,990
cameras

10309
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,380
rolling.

10310
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:05,010
But

10311
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:05,910
what

10312
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:05,940
are

10313
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:06,120
you

10314
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,540
looking

10315
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:06,960
for,

10316
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,200
that

10317
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:07,290
the

10318
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:07,770
patient

10319
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:07,980
might

10320
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:08,220
not

10321
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:08,340
be

10322
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:08,700
aware

10323
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:08,940
of?

10324
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:09,360
In

10325
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,480
other

10326
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:09,690
words,

10327
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:09,900
can

10328
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,080
you

10329
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,380
see

10330
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:10,920
depression

10331
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:11,040
in

10332
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:11,490
somebody's

10333
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,150
eyes?

10334
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,110
And

10335
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:13,800
if

10336
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:13,890
you

10337
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:14,130
know

10338
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:14,190
a

10339
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:14,580
patient

10340
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:14,820
or if

10341
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:14,910
you

10342
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:15,240
don't,

10343
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,450
can

10344
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:15,570
you

10345
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:15,810
see

10346
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,080
it in

10347
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,590
their

10348
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:17,520
body

10349
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,120
posture

10350
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:18,300
when

10351
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,390
they

10352
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:18,750
walk

10353
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,020
in?

10354
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,670
realizing

10355
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:20,760
Of

10356
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,060
course,

10357
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,240
that

10358
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,300
a

10359
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:21,630
trained

10360
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,380
psychiatrist

10361
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:22,620
like

10362
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,160
yourself,

10363
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,180
develops

10364
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:24,270
an

10365
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:24,810
intuitive

10366
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:25,230
sense

10367
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:25,590
that's

10368
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,340
aggregating

10369
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:26,760
lots

10370
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:26,970
of

10371
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:27,360
different

10372
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:27,870
features

10373
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:28,050
of a

10374
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:28,500
patient.

10375
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:28,740
Yeah,

10376
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:29,160
but

10377
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:29,340
what

10378
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:29,520
about

10379
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:29,670
the

10380
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,940
eyes?

10381
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,180
what's

10382
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:30,540
what's

10383
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:30,810
going

10384
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:30,990
on

10385
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:31,260
there?

10386
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:31,500
Yeah,

10387
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,220
the

10388
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:32,490
eyes

10389
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:32,760
are

10390
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,420
incredibly

10391
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:33,750
rich

10392
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:33,900
in

10393
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,590
information.

10394
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,190
And

10395
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:36,300
as,

10396
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:36,690
as

10397
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:36,810
you

10398
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,110
allude

10399
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:37,290
to,

10400
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:37,560
though,

10401
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:37,770
it's

10402
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:38,040
not

10403
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:38,340
as if

10404
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:38,580
any

10405
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,120
one

10406
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:40,860
measurable

10407
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,370
conveys

10408
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:41,520
all

10409
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:41,610
the

10410

as

10615
01:03:57,870 --> 01:03:58,140
well,

10616
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:58,590
in

10617
01:03:58,590 --> 01:03:58,770
many

10618
01:03:58,770 --> 01:03:59,370
cases,

10619
01:03:59,400 --> 01:03:59,520
you

10620
01:03:59,520 --> 01:03:59,790

10621
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:00,000
in

10622
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,540

10623
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:00,960
sometimes

10624
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,080
it's

10625
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:01,260
over

10626
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:01,350

10629
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:01,860
you

10630
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,100
have

10631
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:02,400
to

10632
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,090
make

10633
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:03,360
key

10634
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,020
decisions.

10635
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:04,590
And

10636
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,970
as a

10637
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,020

10638
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:07,140

10639
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:07,260
know,

10640
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:07,650
vividly

10641
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:08,130
being

often

10646
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:10,620
you

10647
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:10,800
have

10648
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:10,920
to

10649
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,250

10650
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:11,910

10661
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,370
people

10662
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:17,520

01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:19,080
can't

10667
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:19,380

10669
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:19,860
can't

10670
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,010
see

10671
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,100
their

10672
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:20,400
body,

10673
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:20,730
anything

10674
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,000
about

10675
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,210
them,

10676
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:21,930
just

10677
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:22,020
the

10678
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,380
sound

10679
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:22,440
of

10680
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:22,710
their

10681
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:23,190
voice.

10682
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:23,310
And

10683
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:23,400
you

10684
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,550
can

10685
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:23,760
ask

10686
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:23,850
them

10687
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:24,660
questions,

10688
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,110
and

10689
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:25,260
you

10690
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:25,410
have

10691
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:25,500
to

10692
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:25,920
make,

10693
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:26,550
in

10694
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:26,730
some

10695
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:27,120
cases,

10696
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:27,360
life

10697
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:27,450
or

10698
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:27,750
death

10699
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:28,350
decisions,

10700
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:28,440
you

10701
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:28,500
know,

10702
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:28,650
is

10703
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:28,800
this

10704
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,250
person

10705
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:29,820
truly

10706
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,500
suicidal,

10707
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,070
something

10708
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:32,250
like

10709
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,520
that

10710
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:32,850
as it

10711
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:33,060
comes

10712
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,180
up

10713
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:33,330
all

10714
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:33,420
the

10715
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:33,750
time?

10716
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,580
And

10717
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:35,820
so I

10718
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,300
developed

10719
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:36,570
over

10720
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:36,750
the

10721
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,080
course

10722
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:37,170
of

10723
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:37,800
training.

10724
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:39,510
And I

10725
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,900
think,

10726
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:40,500
oh,

10727
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:40,860
all

10728
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,460
psychiatrists

10729
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:41,640
do

10730
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:41,880
this

10731
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,060
as

10732
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,180
you

10733
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:42,570
develop

10734
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:42,840
a way

10735
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,380
to

10736
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:44,130
whatever

10737
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:44,370
data

10738
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:44,640
stream

10739
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:44,730
you

10740
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:45,000
have,

10741
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:45,210
whether

10742
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:45,330
it's

10743
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:45,450
the

10744
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:45,870
eyes

10745
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:46,080
or

10746
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,320
whether

10747
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,590
it's

10748
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:46,860
just

10749
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:46,950
the

10750
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:47,490
sound

10751
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:47,670
of a

10752
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:47,970
voice

10753
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:48,210
coming

10754
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:48,360
over

10755
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:48,450
the

10756
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:48,840
phone.

10757
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:49,680
You

10758
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:49,890
want

10759
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:49,950
to

10760
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,190
hone

10761
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:50,520
in on

10762
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:50,730
that

10763
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:51,000
data

10764
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,270
stream

10765
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:51,360
you

10766
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:51,720
have

10767
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,110
and

10768
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,070
focus

10769
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:53,370
on it

10770
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:53,520
and

10771
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,360
identify

10772
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,350
changes

10773
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:55,770
and

10774
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:57,300
it's

10775
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:57,570
quite

10776
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,140
amazing.

10777
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,070
I

10778
01:04:59,070 --> 01:04:59,430
found

10779
01:04:59,430 --> 01:04:59,580

10780
01:04:59,580 --> 01:04:59,970
you

10781
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,120
And

10782
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:00,810
actually,

10783
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:01,740
if

10784
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:01,830
you

10785
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,010
know

10786
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:02,070
a

01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:02,550
patient,

10788
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:03,510
you

10789
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:03,690
can

10790
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:04,140
detect

10791
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:04,380
very

10792
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:04,800
precise

10793
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,250
changes

10794
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:05,370
in

10795
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:05,730

10796
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:06,000
just

10797
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,150
from

10798
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,210
the

10805
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,220
you

10806
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:08,580
can

10807
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:08,910
have

10808
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:09,390
a

10809
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,010
realization

10810
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:11,160

10811
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:11,280
oh,

10812
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:11,460

depression

10815
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:12,720
has

10816
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:13,350
improved,

10817
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:14,340
you

10818
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:14,550
know

10819
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,180
by by

10820
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:15,420
about

10821
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:15,810
half

10822
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,110
just

10823
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:16,530
by

10824
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:16,830
the

10825
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,430
tone

10826
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,550
of

10827
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:17,850
their

10828
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:17,970
of

10829
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:18,120
their

10830
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:18,600
voice.

10831
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,930
And

10832
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:19,800
same

10833
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:19,920
with

10834
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,220
eyes

10835
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:20,310
you

10836
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:20,550
can

10837
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:20,760
with

10838
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:20,970
enough

10839
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:21,420
practice,

10840
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:21,510
you

10841
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,660
can

10842
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,020
get

10843
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:22,560
in

10844
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,070
enough

10845
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:23,670
information

10846
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,880
from

10847
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:23,940
a

10848
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:24,240
single

10849
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:24,480
data

10850
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:24,780
stream

10851
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:24,870
to

10852
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:25,050
give

10853
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:25,110
you

10854
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:25,350
some

10855
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:25,860
information.

10856
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:26,700
But

10857
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:26,940
when

10858
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:27,030
you

10859
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:27,150
do

10860
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:27,360
have

10861
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:27,420
the

10862
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:27,570
whole

10863
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:27,960
picture

10864
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,170
that

10865
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:28,290
of

10866
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:28,590
course

10867
01:05:28,590 --> 01:05:28,740
is

10868
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,160
best.

10869
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:30,390
So,

10870
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,170
so

10871
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,350
many

10872
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:31,740
theories

10873
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:31,980
out

10874
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:32,250
there

10875
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:32,790
about

10876
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,470
excessive

10877
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,010
blinking

10878
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:35,130
and

10879
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:35,850
lying,

10880
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:36,360
lack

10881
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:36,450
of

10882
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:36,810
blinking

10883
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:36,930
and

10884
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:37,980
sociopathy.

10885
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:39,120
I

10886
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:39,300
like

10887
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:39,360
to

10888
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:39,720
remind

10889
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,050
people

10890
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:40,350
that

10891
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:41,610
people

10892
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:41,760
have

10893
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,090
varying

10894
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:42,420
degrees

10895
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:42,510
of

10896
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,110
lubrication

10897
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:43,200
of

10898
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,350
the

10899
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:43,620
eyes,

10900
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:43,830
which

10901
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:44,160
also

10902
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:44,550
influence

10903
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:44,640
the

10904
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,180
frequency

10905
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:45,300
of

10906
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:45,780
blinking

10907
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:45,990
and

10908
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,470
presumably

10909
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:46,680
have

10910
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,010
nothing

10911
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:47,310
to do

10912
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:47,610
with

10913
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,540
whether

10914
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:48,570
or

10915
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:48,840
not

10916
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:49,170
what

10917
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:49,290
they're

10918
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:49,560
saying

10919
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:49,710
is

10920
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:49,920
true

10921
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:50,010
or

10922
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:50,310
not.

10923
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:51,000
But

10924
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,180
it's

10925
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:51,750
incredible

10926
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,320
nonetheless,

10927
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:52,530
that

10928
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:52,800
it's

10929
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:53,040
that

10930
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,160
the

10931
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,460
eyes

10932
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:53,640
are a

10933
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:54,120
portal

10934
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:54,570
to

10935
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,710
overall

10936
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:56,130
arousal

10937
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:56,520
state,

10938
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:56,670
I'm

10939
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:57,120
fascinated

10940
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:57,240
by

10941
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:57,390
the

10942
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:57,750
effects

10943
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,870
of

10944
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:58,140
light

10945
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:58,290
on

10946
01:05:58,290 --> 01:05:58,710
circadian

10947
01:05:58,710 --> 01:05:59,010
biology

10948
01:05:59,010 --> 01:05:59,100
and

10949
01:05:59,100 --> 01:05:59,220
just

10950
01:05:59,220 --> 01:05:59,850
overall

10951
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:00,930
desire

10952
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:01,140
to be

10953
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,440
awake

10954
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:01,530
or

10955
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:01,980
asleep,

10956
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,490
etc.

10957
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:04,410
So

10958
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:04,530
the

10959
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:04,770
eyes

10960
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:04,830
are

10961
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:04,950
on

10962
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:05,040
the

10963
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,490
outside

10964
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:05,550
of

10965
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:05,640
the

10966
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,000
cranial

10967
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,420
vault,

10968
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:06,570
the

10969
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:06,960
Vegas

10970
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,080
is

10971
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,860
outside

10972
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:08,610
the

10973
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:09,750
cranial

10974
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,990
vault,

10975
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,710
obviously.

10976
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,030
What

10977
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:12,600
about

10978
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,810
the

10979
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:13,410
goodies

10980
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:13,860
in

10981
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,400
here?

10982
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,380
Parkinson's,

10983
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:16,560
we

10984
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:16,770
know

10985
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:17,190
the

10986
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:17,460
at

10987
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:17,730
least

10988
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:17,970
one

10989
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,120
of

10990
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:18,300
the

10991
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:18,690
major

10992
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,080
sites

10993
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,380
of

10994
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:20,310
degeneration

10995
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:20,430
and

10996
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:20,940
failure

10997
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:21,090
that

10998
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,300
lead

10999
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:21,390
to

11000
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:21,600
those

11001
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,200
symptoms.

11002
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:24,420
I can

11003
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:24,660
name

11004
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:24,870
off

11005
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:25,020
any

11006
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:25,290
number

11007
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:25,380
of

11008
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:25,560
other

11009
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:25,860

11010
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:26,010
in

11011
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,130
your

11012
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:26,370
book,

11013
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:26,580
you

11014
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:26,790
talk

11015
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:26,940
about

11016
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,030
the

a,

11065
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,180
you

11066
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:45,750
stimulate

11067
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:46,170
that,

11068
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:46,470
and

11069
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:46,710
then

11070
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,830
they

11071
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,370
actively

01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:47,670

11073
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,880
they,

11074
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,210
they

11075
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:48,480
get

11076
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:48,780
their

11078
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:49,560
going,

11079
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:49,680
and

11080
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:49,920
they

11081
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:50,100
and

11082
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,190
they

11083
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:50,280
are

11084
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:50,460
able

11085
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:50,550
to

01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:50,790
lean

11087
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:51,000
into

01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,330
life.

11089
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,440
So

11090
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,130
how

11091
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:53,490
do

11092
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:53,760
how

11093
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:53,970
does

11094
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,300
one

11095
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:54,570
get

11096
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:54,780
to

11097
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,050
those

11098
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:55,680
structures

11099
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:55,890
in a

11100
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:56,100
in a

11101
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:56,640
focused

11102
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,030
way?

11103
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:58,080
And

11104
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,250
what

11105
01:06:59,250 --> 01:06:59,460
what

11106
01:06:59,460 --> 01:06:59,520
are

11107
01:06:59,520 --> 01:06:59,640
the

11108
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:00,150
next

11109
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:00,540
two

11110
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:00,840
to

11111
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:01,410
five

11112
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:01,740
to 10

11113
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,040
years

11114
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:02,250
look

11115
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:02,610
like?

11116
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:03,630
Well,

11117
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:03,810
this

11118
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:03,990
is

11119
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:04,140
the

11120
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:04,410
this

11121
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:04,530
is

11122
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:04,620
the

11123
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,010
promise

11124
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:05,190
on

11125
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,400
that.

11126
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,580
And

11127
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:05,820
it is

11128
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,270
on a

11129
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,350
timescale

11130
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:08,400
that

11131
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,490
I

11132
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:08,760
think

11133
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,150
things

11134
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:09,690
may

11135
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:10,050
start

11136
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:10,140
to

11137
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:10,410
play

11138
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:10,710
out.

11139
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:12,180
You

11140
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:12,300
know

11141
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:12,510
that

11142
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:12,600
the

11143
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,260
specificity

11144
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,350
of

11145
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,250
optogenetics

11146
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:15,090
is

11147
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:15,360
really

11148
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:15,540
only

11149
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,320
useful

11150
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:16,770
if

11151
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:16,920
you

11152
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:17,490
have

11153
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:17,940
some

11154
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:18,240
idea

11155
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:18,330
of

11156
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:18,420
how

11157
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:18,540
to

11158
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:18,780
use

11159
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:19,050
that

11160
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,040
specificity.

11161
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:20,970
And

11162
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,260
it's

11163
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:22,350
an

11164
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:22,680
actually,

11165
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:22,830
it's

11166
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:22,890
a

11167
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:23,400
frustrating

11168
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:23,880
aspect

11169
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,060
of

11170
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:24,750
psychiatry

11171
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:24,870
that

11172
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,960
in

11173
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,170
many

11174
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:25,770
cases,

11175
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:26,460
the

11176
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:26,880
most

11177
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,360
effective

11178
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:27,720
treatments

11179
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:27,840
we

11180
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,320
have

11181
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,190
have

11182
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,280
the

11183
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:29,700
least

11184
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:30,660
specificity,

11185
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:31,740
electroconvulsive

11186
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:32,100
therapy

11187
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,310
being

11188
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:32,400
a

11189
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:32,730
great

11190
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:33,210
example,

11191
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,510
where

11192
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,630
you're

11193
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:33,990
causing

11194
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:34,050
a

11195
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:34,350
brain

11196
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:34,800
wide,

11197
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:35,100
which

11198
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:35,340
looks

11199
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:35,940
barbaric,

11200
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:36,090
but

11201
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:36,210
as

11202
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:36,300
you

11203
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:36,690
mentioned,

11204
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,050
is

11205
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:37,650
effective.

11206
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:37,770
I

11207
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:37,980
mean,

11208
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:38,400
it is

11209
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:38,940
it

11210
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:39,420
these

11211
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:39,750
days,

11212
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:40,110
it's

11213
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:40,320
much

11214
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:40,470
more

11215
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,190
clinically,

11216
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:41,520
you

11217
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:41,670
know,

11218
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:41,760
it

11219
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,030
doesn't

11220
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:42,180
look

11221

11238
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:45,660
it's

01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:45,690
a

11246
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,420
But

11247
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:49,650
what

01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:51,420
yeah,

11253
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,840
it is

11254
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:52,290
it is

11255
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:52,470
good.

11256
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:52,650
It's

you're

certainly

11325
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:13,890

01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:15,780
that's

11334
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:16,260
the

likewise,

01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:19,530
with

11343
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:20,400
this

11424
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:50,520
muscarinic

11425
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,360
certainly

11426
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:51,600
acts

11427
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:51,750
on

11428
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:52,140
dopamine

11429
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:52,770
receptors,

11430
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,160
but

11431
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:53,790
it

11432
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,170
causes,

11433
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:55,530
you

11434
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:55,740
know,

11435
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:56,160
blood

11436
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:56,910
blood

11437
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,450
cell

11438
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,140
counts,

11439
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:58,290
how

11440
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:58,410
do

11441
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:58,710
people

11442
01:08:58,710 --> 01:08:59,220
feel?

11443
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,330
So if

11444
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:00,780
I'm,

11445
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,080
if I

11446
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,200
were

11447
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,010
schizophrenic,

11448
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,880
and I

11449
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:02,970
was

11450
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:03,150
getting

11451
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:03,570
auditory

11452
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,320
hallucinations,

11453
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:04,950
etc,

11454
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:05,460
and I

11455
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:05,670
took

11456
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,000
close

11457
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,420
pain?

11458
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:08,820
What

11459
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:09,060
could

11460
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:09,150
I

11461
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:09,600
expect

11462
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:09,720
to

11463
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,140
feel?

11464
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,280
Well,

11465
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:11,730
so

11466
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:11,880
you

11467
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:12,030
would

11468
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,600
notice

11469
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,200
side

11470
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,530
effects

11471
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:13,710
and

11472
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:13,800
you

11473
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:13,890
would

11474
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,370
notice

11475
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,060
resolution

11476
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:15,450
of

11477
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:15,870
symptoms

11478
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:16,200
both

11479
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:16,470
and

11480
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:16,650
so

11481
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:16,740
the

11482
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:17,190
voices

11483
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:17,340
would

11484
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:17,520
go

11485
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:17,730
away,

11486
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:17,970
but

11487
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:18,720
in a

11488
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:18,990
good

11489
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:19,770
situation,

11490
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:20,250
the

11491
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:20,580
voices

11492
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:20,700
would

11493
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:20,820
go

11494
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:21,090
away.

11495
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:21,270
That's

11496
01:09:21,270 --> 01:09:21,390
right.

11497
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:21,660
But I

11498
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:21,840
would

11499
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,170
feel

11500
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:22,470
not

11501
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,710
good

11502
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:22,980
in my

11503
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:23,460
body,

11504
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:23,820
you

11505
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:23,970
would

11506
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:24,480
have

11507
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,140
you

11508
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,320
might

11509
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:25,500
have

11510
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,250
dizziness,

11511
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:26,340
you

11512
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:26,550
might

11513
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:27,180
have

11514
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,830
drooling,

11515
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:28,980
you

11516
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:29,250
might

11517
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:29,910
have

11518
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:30,600
any

11519
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,020
number

11520
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,470
of

11521
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:34,710
physical

11522
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:35,760
sensations

11523
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:35,970
that

11524
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:36,120
that

11525
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:36,330
would

11526
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:36,510
be

11527
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:36,660
due

11528
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:36,750
to

11529
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:37,050
these

11530
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:37,320
off

11531
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:37,680
target

11532
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,190
effects,

11533
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:38,610
the

11534
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,090
medication

11535
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:39,360
acting

11536
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:39,480
on

11537
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:39,630
these

11538
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:39,810
other

11539
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:40,440
receptors.

11540
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:40,649
And

11541
01:09:40,649 --> 01:09:40,739
I'm

11542
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:41,069
certainly

11543
01:09:41,069 --> 01:09:41,219
not

11544
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:41,669
suggesting

11545
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,789
this.

11546
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:41,909
But

11547
01:09:41,909 --> 01:09:42,089
what

11548
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:42,149
if

11549
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:42,479
somebody

11550
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:42,779
without

11551
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,439
schizophrenia

11552
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:43,589
to

11553
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:43,979
close

11554
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:44,099
up

11555
01:09:44,099 --> 01:09:44,339
been?

11556
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:45,359
They

11557
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:45,539
had

11558
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:45,599
the

11559
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:45,839
same

11560
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:46,079
side

11561
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:46,409
effects,

11562
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:46,949
presumably.

11563
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:47,519
And

11564
01:09:47,519 --> 01:09:47,819
so it

11565
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:47,909
would

11566
01:09:47,909 --> 01:09:48,149
not

11567
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,449
be

11568
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:48,959
something

11569
01:09:48,959 --> 01:09:49,109
that

11570
01:09:49,139 --> 01:09:49,559
that

11571
01:09:49,619 --> 01:09:49,829
I

11572
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,979
would

11573
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:50,519
recommend,

11574
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:51,059
do

11575
01:09:51,059 --> 01:09:51,719
psychiatrists

11576
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:52,080
take

11577
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:52,260
the

11578
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:52,650
drugs

11579
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:52,770
that

11580
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:52,890
they

11581
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:53,400
prescribe,

11582
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:53,700
I

11583
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:53,940
just

11584
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:54,390
finished

11585
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:54,600
up

11586
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:54,780
for

11587
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:54,870
the

11588
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:55,140
third

11589
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:55,470
time.

11590
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,220
Oliver

11591
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:56,610
Sacks

11592
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:56,940
his

11593
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:58,410
autobiography

11594
01:09:58,410 --> 01:09:58,590
which

11595
01:09:58,590 --> 01:09:58,740
is

11596
01:09:58,740 --> 01:09:59,310
marvelous

11597
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,580
and

11598
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,240
and I

11599
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:00,540
highly

11600
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:00,960
recommend

11601
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,020
to

11602
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:01,470
people,

11603
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,310
he

11604
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:02,670
certainly

11605
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:02,850
took

11606
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:03,090
a lot

11607
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:03,180
of

11608
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:03,720
drugs,

11609
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:05,400
not

11610
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:05,520
as

11611
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:05,730
part

11612
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:05,820
of

11613
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:05,940
his

11614
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:06,570
professional

11615
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:06,990
role,

11616
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,640
but

11617
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:09,270
just

11618
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,420
out

11619
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:09,480
of

11620
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,050
curiosity,

11621
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:10,260
what

11622
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:10,500
is

11623
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:10,890
the

11624
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:11,700
interest

11625
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:11,940

01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:20,670
about

actually

01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:22,800
be

11660
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,010
some

11661
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,460
benefit

11662
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:23,610

01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:24,780
the

11666
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:25,350

01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:25,980
drugs

11670
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:26,160
was

11671
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:26,460
like

11675
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:27,480
I

11676
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:27,720
think

11677
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,170
that's

11678
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,410
that's

11679
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:28,860
true.

11680
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:29,430

that

11684
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:30,720
probably

11685
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,050
many

11686
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:31,170

01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,910
they

11830
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,120
walk

11831
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:21,210
out

11832
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:21,270
of

11833
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,360
the

11834
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:21,750
office,

11835
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,870
and

11836
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:21,990
they

11837
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,200
have

11838
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:22,380
a

11839
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:22,860
life

11840
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,580
experience

11841
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:24,480
that

11842
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:24,870
extends

11843
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:25,230
beyond

11844
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:25,290
the

11845
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:25,800
script.

11846
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,340
Yeah.

11847
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,180
And

11848
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:27,420
so

11849
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:27,630
and

11850
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:27,810
yeah,

11851
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:27,930
and

11852
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,080
so

11853
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,230
that

11854
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:29,220
so at

11855
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,310
the

11856
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:29,550
same

11857
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:29,820
time,

11858
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,240
though,

11859
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:30,540
you

11860
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:30,810
can't

11861
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:30,960
let

11862
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:31,140
that

11863
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,620
completely

11864
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:31,920
guide

11865
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,010
your

11866
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:32,340
clinical

11867
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:32,760
decisions,

11868
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:33,300
because

11869
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:33,510
as I

11870
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:33,900
mentioned,

11871
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:34,110
some

11872
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:34,200
of

11873
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,620
these

11874
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:35,310
medications

11875
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:35,400
that

11876
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:35,580
have

11877
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:35,670
the

11878
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:35,880
most

11879
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,090
side

11880
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,450
effects,

11881
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:36,600
they

11882
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:36,690
are

11883
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,020
also

11884
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,110
the

11885
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,380
most

11886
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:37,830
effective.

11887
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,460
And

11888
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:38,790
cause

11889
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,940
pain

11890
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,060
is a

11891
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,240
great

11892
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:39,600
example

11893
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:39,840
that

11894
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:39,960
will

11895
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:40,230
work

11896
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:40,380
in

11897
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:40,860
patients

11898
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,010
where

11899
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,340
nothing

11900
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:41,610
else

11901
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:42,030
works.

11902
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:42,870
And

11903
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:43,170
believe

11904
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:43,290
me,

11905
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:43,380
we

11906
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:43,620
don't

11907
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:43,950
take

11908
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:44,040
the

11909
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:44,370

11910
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:44,730

lightly,

11915
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,070
because

11916
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:47,190
of

11917
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:47,310
all

11918
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:47,610
these

11919
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:47,790
these

11920
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:48,000
side

11921
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:48,270
effects,

11922
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:48,360
you

11923
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:48,450
have

11924
01:11:48,450 --> 01:11:48,570
to

11925
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:48,780
come

11926
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:48,990
in

11927

11931
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:50,970
or

11932
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:51,150
every

11933
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:51,360

11938
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:52,440
check

11939
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:52,530
to

11940
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:52,710
make

11941
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:52,950
sure

11942
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:53,100
that

11943
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,310
the

11945
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:53,940

11946
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:54,000
are

11947
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,210
not

11948
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:54,540
off,

11949
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,410
for

11950
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:55,800
example,

11951
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,130
but

11952
01:11:56,430 --> 01:11:56,640
there

11953
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:56,670
are

11954
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,030
patients

11955
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,180
where

11956
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:57,630
no

11957
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:57,840
other

11958
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,350
medication

11959
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:58,620
works

11960
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:58,710
with

11961
01:11:58,740 --> 01:11:59,310
schizophrenia

11962
01:11:59,310 --> 01:11:59,520
and

11963
01:11:59,520 --> 01:11:59,880
kloset.

11964
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,060
Being

11965
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:00,360
works

11966
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:00,870
amazingly

11967
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,260
well.

11968
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,070
And

11969
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,340
so we

11970
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:02,520
do

11971
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:02,730
it,

11972
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,840
even

11973
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,020
though

11974
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,170
there

11975
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:04,590
are

11976
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:04,920
side

11977
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:05,280
effects.

11978
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:05,430
And

11979
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:05,580
so

11980
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:05,760
then

11981
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:05,910
this

11982
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:06,150
comes

11983
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:06,420
back

11984
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:06,540
to

11985
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:06,960
your

11986
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:07,290
question,

11987
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:07,440
what

11988
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:07,650
if we

11989
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:08,010
had

11990
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:08,250
better

11991
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:08,340
and

11992
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:08,610
better

11993
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:09,450
specificity?

11994
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:10,320
Well,

11995
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:11,160
only

11996
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:11,370
if we

11997
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:11,580
know

11998
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:11,940
exactly

11999
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,060
what

12000
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,150
we're

12001
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:12,420
doing

12002
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:12,570
is

12003
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:12,660
the

12004
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:12,960
point.

12005
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,080
And

12006
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:13,230
so

12007
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:13,530
because

12008
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:13,920
as we

12009
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,280
become

12010
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:14,430
more

12011
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,150
refined,

12012
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,020
we

12013
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:16,230
better

12014
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:16,350
be

12015
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:16,680
right

12016
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:17,100
about

12017
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:17,490
where

12018
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:17,850
we're

12019
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:18,330
refining

12020
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:18,570
to.

12021
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:19,590
And

12022
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,800
you

12023
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,190
imagine

12024
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:20,430
a day

12025
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:20,670
where

12026
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:20,790
it

12027
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,910
will

12028
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:21,090
be a

12029
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:21,810
single,

12030
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:22,830
maybe

12031
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,010

12067
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,440
is

01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:34,620
that

12069
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:34,800
how

12070
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,190
you

01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:35,790
envision

12072
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,150
this?

12073
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:36,900
That

12074
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:37,230
certainly

12075
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:37,410
could

12076
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:37,710
happen?

12077
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:37,830
What

12078
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:38,310
I

12079
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:38,550
what

12080
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:38,640
I

12081
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,300
actually

12082
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,350
prefer,

12083
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:40,560
as a

12084
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,100
vision

12085
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:41,820
is,

12086
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:42,180
is

12087
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,660
still

12088
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:43,590
medications,

12089
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,730
because

12090
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:45,750
those

12091
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:46,470
are,

12092
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:46,860
you

12093
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:47,010
know,

12094
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:47,400
minimally

12095
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,150
invasive.

12096
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:49,050
If we

12097
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:49,200
knew

12098
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:49,320
what

12099
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:49,410
we

12100
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:49,500
were

12101
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:49,860
doing,

12102
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:49,980
we

12103
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:50,130
could

12104
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,340
make

12105
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:50,490
them

12106
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:50,700
more

12107
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,420
specific,

12108
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,230
have

12109
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:52,440
fewer

12110
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:52,680
side

12111
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,160
effects.

12112
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:54,330
But

12113
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,170
optogenetics,

12114
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:55,410
that'll

12115
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:55,710
arm

12116
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,040
us

12117
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,610
with

12118
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:56,940
true

12119
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:57,330
causal

12120
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,020
understanding?

12121
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:58,200
And

12122
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:58,350
so

12123
01:12:58,350 --> 01:12:58,530
we'll

12124
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,130
know.

12125
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:00,240
And

12126
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:00,390
we're

12127
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,810
already

12128
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,230
moving

12129
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:01,770
rapidly

12130
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:02,040
toward

12131
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:02,190
this

12132
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:02,460
point,

12133
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:02,580
well,

12134
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:02,910
no,

12135
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:03,450
okay,

12136
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:03,870
this

12137
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:04,380
symptom,

12138
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,610
the

12139
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,000

12140
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,120

12142
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:06,660
in

01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:06,960
life

12144
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:07,110
that

12145
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:07,200
we

12146
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:07,470
call

12147
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,220
anhedonia,

12148
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:08,730
or

12149
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:08,910
the

12150
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,300

12151
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:09,900

12153
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,040
or,

12154
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:11,610
or

12155
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:12,060

01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:12,360

01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:12,780
overcome

12158
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:13,350

12159
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,710
active

12160

coping,

12161
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,080
these

12162
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:16,710
are

12163
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,520
largely

12164
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,510
subserved,

01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:18,990
largely

12173
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:21,900

01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:22,020
the

01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,680
that's

inhabits

circuit.

12181
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,300
And

12182
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:24,450
we

12183
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:24,600
will

12184
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:24,840
know

12185
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,050
that

12186
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:25,800
because

12187
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:26,070
of

12188
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,160
the

12189
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,430
work

12190
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:26,610
done

12191
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:26,730
with

12192
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,030
channel

12193
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,330
Ops,

12194
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:27,900
exactly,

12195
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,140
yeah,

12196
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:28,290
I

12197
01:13:28,290 --> 01:13:28,680
agree

12198
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:28,890
in

12199
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:29,100
ways

12200
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:29,190
that

12201
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:29,610
we

12202
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:29,970
never

12203
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:30,180
could

12204
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:30,360
have

12205
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:30,420
the

12206
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,140
confidence

12207
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:31,950
otherwise.

12208
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,430
And

12209
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:32,580
so

12210
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:32,700
we'll

12211
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:33,300
know

12212
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:33,540
that

12213
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:33,690
this

12214
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:33,810
is

12215
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:33,900
the

12216
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,320
circuit

12217
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:34,590
that

12218
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:34,920
that

12219
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,670
underlies

12220
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:35,850
the

12221
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,450
symptom,

12222
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,900
or

12223
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,020
its

12224
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:37,710
resolution.

12225
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,120
And

12226
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:39,750
then

12227
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:40,800
we'll

12228
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,130
get

12229
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:41,220
to

12230
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:41,700
understand

12231
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:41,880
these

12232
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,300
cells

12233
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:42,570
very

12234
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:42,900
deeply.

12235
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,290
Okay,

12236
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:43,530
these

12237
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:43,830
cells

12238
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,950
that

12239
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:44,190
are

12240
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:44,700
causal

12241
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:44,910
that

12242
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:45,150
do

12243
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:45,750
matter.

12244
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,710
Who

12245
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:46,860
are

12246
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,010
they?

12247
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:47,190
What

12248
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:47,250
do

12249
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:47,730
they

12250
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,060
what's

12251
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:48,210
their

12252
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:48,750
wiring?

12253
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:48,960
What

12254
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,050
are

12255
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:49,440
the

12256
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:50,040
proteins

12257
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,160
that

12258
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:50,340
they

12259
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:50,790
make?

12260
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:51,330
What

12261
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:51,450
are

12262
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:51,540
the

12263
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,050
little

12264
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,340
things

12265
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:53,430
that

12266
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,610
on

12267
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:53,670
the

12268
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:54,060
surface

12269
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,150
of

12270
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:54,210
the

12271
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:54,780
cell

12272
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,020
that

12273
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:55,140
could

12274
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,260
be

12275
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:55,860
receptors

12276
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:55,980
for

12277
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:56,460
specific

12278
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,240
medications,

12279
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:57,840
or

12280
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,770
combinations

12281
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,250
of

12282
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,270
receptors

12283
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:00,450
that

12284
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:00,540
would

12285
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:00,720
give

12286
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:00,840
us

12287
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:00,930
the

12288
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,710
specificity

12289
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:01,830
we

12290
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:02,130
need.

12291
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:03,030
And

12292
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,390
then

12293
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:03,840
armed

12294
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:03,990
with

12295
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:04,500
that

12296
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,610
causal

12297
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:05,880
and

12298
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,450
precise

12299
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:06,600
and

12300
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:06,930
rigorous

12301
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:07,380
knowledge,

12302
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:07,770
then

12303
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:08,370
you

12304
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:08,520
can

12305
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:08,940
imagine

12306
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:09,570
medication

12307
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,020
development

12308
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:10,380
becoming

12309
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:10,710
totally

12310
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,070
different,

12311
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:11,220
no

12312
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:11,610
longer

12313
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:12,570
serendipitous,

12314
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:13,410
but

12315
01:14:13,410 --> 01:14:13,740
truly

12316
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:14,220
grounded

12317
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:14,400
in

12318
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,090
causality.

12319
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:15,540
I

12320
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:15,780
see.

12321
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,080
So

12322
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:16,650
using

12323
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,400
channel

12324
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:17,790
options

12325
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:17,940
as a

12326
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,090
way

12327
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:18,180
to

12328
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:18,600
probe

12329
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:18,660
the

12330
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,170
circuitry

12331
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:19,260
and

12332
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:19,560
figure

12333
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:19,860
out

12334
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:20,040
the

12335
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:20,550
sites

12336
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,760
that

12337
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,150
are

12338
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:22,170
disrupted,

12339
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:23,190
what

12340
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:23,580
patterns

12341
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:23,670
of

12342
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:24,090
activity

12343
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:24,150
are

12344
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:24,840
required.

12345
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:25,110
And

12346
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,440
then

12347
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:25,710
by

12348
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:26,490
understanding

12349
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,000
the

12350
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,780
constituents

12351
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:27,870
of

12352
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:28,080
those

12353
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:28,380
cells,

12354
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:28,560
like

12355
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:28,770
what

12356
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:28,890
they

12357
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,400
express

12358
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:29,490
and

12359
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:29,610
what

12360
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:29,730
they

12361
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:30,000
make,

12362
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:30,240
then

12363
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:30,690
developing

12364
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:31,110
drugs

12365
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,230
that

12366
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:31,410
could

12367
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:31,860
target

12368
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,100
those

12369
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,640
cells,

12370
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:33,210
not

12371
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:33,720
necessarily

12372
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:34,020
putting

12373
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:34,290
light

12374
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:34,740
inducing

12375
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,280

12376
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:35,490
into

12377
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:35,580
the

12378
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:35,940
brain

12379
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,180
or

12380
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:37,170
walking

12381
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,380
around

12382
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:37,500
with

12383
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:37,830
wire

12384
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:38,190

12385
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:38,610
attached

12386
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:38,760
our

skull

12388
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:39,270
or

12389
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:39,480
something

12390
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:39,570
like

12391
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:39,660
that.

12392
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:41,220
That's

12393
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,030
fantastic.

12394
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:42,270
And

12395
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:43,890
and I

12396
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:44,460
realized

12397
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:44,640
no

12398
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:44,820
one

01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:45,030

12401
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:45,840
ball.

12402
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:46,740
But

12403
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,610
what

12404
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:47,670
do

12405
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:47,760
you

12406
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:47,970
think

12407
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:48,090
the

12408
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:48,600
arc

12409
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:49,890
of of

12410
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:50,100
that

12411
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:50,310
is?

12412
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:50,850
Meaning?

12413
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,300
Are

12414
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:51,420
we

12415
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,600
gonna

12416
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:51,780
see

12417
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:51,990
that

12418
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,410
in a

12419
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:52,920
year

12420
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,190
in

12421
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:53,370
two

12422
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:53,970
years,

12423
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:54,360
three

12424
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,630
years

12425
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:55,320
in,

12426
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:55,530
let

12427
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:55,650
me

12428
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:56,040
reframe

12429
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:56,310
that.

12430
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:57,090
If

12431
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:57,720
How

12432
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,230
soon

12433
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:58,800
will

12436
01:14:59,730 --> 01:14:59,970
Bay

12437
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,840

01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:07,890

Okay,

01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,530
Now,

12724
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:54,690
In

humans,

12726
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,200
I

12727
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:55,410
should

12728
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:55,620
add,

12729
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,580
and

12730
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:56,910
even

12731
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:57,240
Yes,

12732
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:57,390
there

12733
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:57,630
was

12734
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,110
there's

12735
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,620
that

12736
01:16:58,770 --> 01:16:59,430
is

12737
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,730
quite

12738
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:00,000
even

12739
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:00,330
separate

12740
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:00,480

12741
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:00,540

12744
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:01,470
as

12745
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:01,680
you

12746
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:02,010
point

12747
01:17:02,010 --> 01:17:02,130
out,

12748
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:02,340
many

12749
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:02,640
people

12750
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:02,790
have

12751
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:02,910
been

12752
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:03,180
doing

12753
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,540
this

12754
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:04,740
in

12755
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:05,100
humans,

12756
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:05,250
as

12757
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:05,400
well

12758
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:05,640
as in

12759
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:05,820

primates.

12762
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:08,250
And

12763
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:08,520
this

12764
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:08,730
is

12765
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:09,420
pretty

12766
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,320
powerful,

12767
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:10,410
it's

12768
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:10,830
important,

12769
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:10,980
this

12770
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:11,100
will

12771
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:11,280
let

12772
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:11,760
us

12773
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:12,570
understand

12774
01:17:12,570 --> 01:17:12,720
what's

12775
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:12,960
going

12776
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:13,230
on in

12777
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:13,290
the

01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:13,680
brain

12779
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,780
in in

12780
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:16,530
psychiatric

12781
01:17:16,530 --> 01:17:17,010
disease

12782
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:17,130
and

01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:17,670
neurological

12784

12785
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:18,180
and

12786
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:18,270
will

12787
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:18,390
give

12788
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,510
us

12789
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:19,020
ideas

12790
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:19,500
for

12791
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:19,980
treatment.

12792
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:22,080
It

12793
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,320
is,

12794
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:22,410
of

12795
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:22,890
course,

12796
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,130
it's

12797
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:23,700
still

12798
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:24,750
invasive,

12799
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:24,840
you

12800
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,200
still

12801
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:25,410
are

12802
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:25,710
talking

12803
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:25,860
about

12804
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:26,100
putting

12805
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:26,160
a

12807
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:28,920
into

12808
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:29,130
the

12809
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:29,610
brain.

12810
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:30,690
And

12811
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,080
that

12812
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:31,140
it

12813
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:31,320
has

12814
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,010
to be

12815
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,170
treated

12816
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:34,920
as a

12817
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:35,340
as a

12818
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:35,880
situation

12819
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,000
that

12820
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,150
has

12821
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:36,300
some

12822
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:36,780
risks,

12823
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:37,380
and

12824
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:37,650
the

12825
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,040
step

12826
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:38,160
that

12827
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:38,340
has

12828
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:38,490
to be

12829
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:38,790
taken

12830
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:39,270
carefully.

12831
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,100
I see

12832
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:41,370
that

12833
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:41,760
as

12834
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,240
something

12835
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,510
that

12836
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:43,260
will

12837
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:43,620
be

12838
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:43,920
part

12839
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:44,010
of

12840
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:44,880
psychiatry,

12841
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,590
in

12842
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:46,650

is I

12998
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:49,590
think,

12999
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,070
it's

13000
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:50,340
great.

13001
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:50,520
It's,

13002
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:50,790
it's

13003
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:51,360
something

course,

13007
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:52,350
will

01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:52,620
be

understanding,

13014
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:54,510
we'll

13015
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:54,690
need

13016
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:54,780

01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:55,320
what

13019
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:55,470
is

13020
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:55,740
that

13021
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,370
pathological

13022
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:56,730

13023
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:56,850
that

13024
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:56,940
we're

13025
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:57,540
detecting.

13026
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:57,750
And

13027
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,810
we

13028
01:18:57,810 --> 01:18:57,990
need

13029
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,050
to

it

13034
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,400
And

13035
01:18:59,400 --> 01:18:59,550
so

13036
01:18:59,550 --> 01:18:59,790
again,

13037
01:18:59,790 --> 01:18:59,970
that's

01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:19,950
treatments,

13250
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:21,090
there's

13251
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:21,330
no

13252
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:21,930
active

13253
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,620
debate

13254
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,250
over

13255
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:24,630
what

13256
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:25,080
fraction

13257
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:25,170
of

13258
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:25,470
people

13259
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:25,560
who

13260
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:25,950
have

13261
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:26,160
these

13262
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:26,850
symptoms

13263
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,990
can

13264
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,050
or

13265
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:28,290
should

13266
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,040
be

13267
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:29,760
treated.

13268
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:30,000
This

13269
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,150
is

13270
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:30,570
typically

13271
01:20:30,570 --> 01:20:31,230
Adderall

13272
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:31,500
or

13273
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:32,280
stimulants

13274
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:32,370
or

13275
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:32,580
some

13276
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:32,880
counter

13277
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,270
examples,

13278
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:33,720
stimulants.

13279
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:33,930
That's

13280
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:34,230
right.

13281
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:34,860
So

13282
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,520
ADHD,

13283
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:35,760
it's

13284
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:36,270
as

13285
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:36,420
its

13286
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:36,630
name

13287
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,110
suggests,

13288
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,200
it

13289
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:37,860
has

13290
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,700
symptoms,

13291
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:39,480
it

13292
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:39,720
can

13293
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:39,900
have

13294
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:40,200
either

13295
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:40,260
a

13296
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:41,190
hyperactive

13297
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:41,880
state

13298
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,210
or an

13299
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:42,960
inattentive

13300
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:43,620
state.

13301
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,060
And

13302
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:45,960
those

13303
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,110
can

13304
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:46,560
be

13305
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,250
completely

13306
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:47,580
separate

13307
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:47,730
from

13308
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:47,850
each

13309
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:48,060
other,

13310
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:48,150
you

13311
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:48,270
could

13312
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:48,390
have

13313
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,450
a

13314
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:48,840
patient

13315
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,680
who

13316
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:50,970
effectively

13317
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:51,840
is

13318
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,020
not

13319
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,620
hyperactive

13320
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:52,710
at

13321
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,100
all,

13322
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:53,400
but

13323
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,880
can't

13324
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:54,570
remain

13325
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:55,020
focused

13326
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:55,320
on

13327
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:55,680
the,

13328
01:20:55,770 --> 01:20:56,070
the

13329
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:56,310
what's

13330
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:56,520
going

13331
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:56,670
on

13332
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:56,940
around

13333
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:57,060
them.

13334
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:57,210
So

13335
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:57,360
their

13336
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:57,750
body

13337
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:57,900
can

13338
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:58,440
still

13339
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:58,620
but

13340
01:20:58,620 --> 01:20:58,890
their

13341
01:20:58,920 --> 01:20:59,100
their

13342
01:20:59,100 --> 01:20:59,520
mind

13343
01:20:59,520 --> 01:20:59,640
is

13344
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,060
darting

13345
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,540
around.

13346
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:00,810
That's

13347
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,080
right,

13348
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:01,410
or

13349
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:01,530
they

13350
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:01,710
can

13351
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:01,890
be

13352
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:02,220
very

13353
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:02,760
hyperactive

13354
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:02,880
with

13355
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,000
their

13356
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:03,510
body,

13357
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:03,720
it

13358
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:03,960
hasn't

13359
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:04,170
spoke

13360
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:04,440
probably

13361
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:04,800
rarely

13362
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:04,890
is

13363
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,160
somebody

13364
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:05,670
hyperactive

13365
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:05,760
with

13366
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:05,850
their

13367
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,090
body,

13368
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:06,210
but

13369
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:06,300
their

13370
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,600
mind

13371
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:06,720
is

13372
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:07,110
still,

13373
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:07,560
although

13374
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:07,620
I

13375
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:07,800
have

13376
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:07,890
to

13377
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:08,130
say

13378
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:08,250
and

13379
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:08,400
this

13380
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:08,730
is a

13381
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,390
benevolent

13382
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:09,720
shout

13383
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:09,870
out

13384
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:09,960
to

13385
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,320
Bhutan,

13386
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:10,830
Raska

13387
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,550
botond,

13388
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:11,610
he

13389
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:11,760
has

13390
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:11,880
an

13391
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,810
incredibly

13392
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,590
sharp

13393
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:13,740
and

13394
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,190
focused

13395
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:14,640
mind.

13396
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:15,540
And

13397
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:15,720
his

13398
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,020
hand

13399
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:16,440
movements

13400
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:16,620
are

13401
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,220
extremely

13402
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:17,700
exact

13403
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:17,970
also.

13404
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:18,240
So I

13405
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:18,420
do

13406
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:18,870
sometimes

13407
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:19,440
wonder

13408
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:20,070
whether

13409
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,100
or

13410
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:20,550
not

13411
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:20,820
our

13412
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,120
body

13413
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:21,480
movements

13414
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:21,540
in

13415
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:21,660
our

13416
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:21,840
head

13417
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,380
movements

13418
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:22,860
are

13419
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:23,250
whether

13420
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:23,280
or

13421
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:23,400
not

13422
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:23,520
their

13423
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,090
coordinator

13424
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:24,660
is or

13425
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:24,960
is a

13426
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,560
readout

13427
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:25,800
of

13428
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:26,400
how

13429
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:26,850
directed

13430
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,000
our

13431
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:27,480
attention

13432
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:27,690
is.

13433
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,830
I

13434
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,160
noticed

13435
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:29,280
I

13436
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:29,520
have

13437
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:29,700
to

13438
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:29,970
think

13439
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,510
complex

13440
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,050
abstract

13441
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:31,380
thoughts,

13442
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:31,500
I

13443
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:31,770
notice

13444
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:31,890
I

13445
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:32,100
have

13446
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,310
to be

13447
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,580
very

13448
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:32,940
still.

13449
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:33,270
So my

13450
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,570
body

13451
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:33,780
has

13452
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:34,080
to be

13453
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:34,470
almost

13454
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,190
completely

13455
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,000
unmoving,

13456
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,150
for

13457
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:36,360
me to

13458
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:36,840
think

13459
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:37,380
very

13460
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,100
abstractly,

13461
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:39,120
and

13462
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,570
deeply.

13463
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:39,930
Other

13464
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:40,170
people

13465
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:40,230
are

13466
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:40,590
different.

13467
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:40,740
Some

13468
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:41,130
people

13469
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:41,310
when

13470
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:41,430
they're

13471
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,760
running,

13472
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:41,850
they

13473
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:42,090
get

13474
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:42,210
their

13475
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:42,480
best

13476
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:42,780
thoughts.

13477
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:42,900
I

13478
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,200
can't

13479
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:43,380
even

13480
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:43,830
imagine

13481
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:44,040
that

13482
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:44,280
my

13483
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:44,580
brain

13484
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:44,730
does

13485
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:44,940
not

13486
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,150
work

13487
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:45,300
that

13488
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:45,450
way

13489
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:45,540
at

13490
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:45,780
all.

13491
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:45,900
I

13492
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:45,990
have

13493
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,200
to be

13494
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:46,500
totally

13495
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:46,860
emotional.

13496
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,030
Which

13497
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:48,180
is

13498
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:48,360
kind

13499
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:48,420
of

13500
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:48,810
interesting.

13501
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,020
How

13502
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:49,080
do

13503
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:49,170
you

13504
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:49,290
go

13505
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:49,560
about

13506
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:49,860
that?

13507
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:50,880
I

13508
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,300
said,

13509
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:51,780
much

13510
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,020
like

13511
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:52,500
this,

13512
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:52,650
you

13513
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:52,770
know,

13514
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:53,670
I try

13515
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:53,760
to

13516
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:54,090
have

13517
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:54,720
time

13518
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,740
each

13519
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:56,130
day

13520
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:56,370
where

13521
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:56,910
I'm

13522
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:57,660
literally

13523
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:58,500
sitting

13524
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,270
almost

13525
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:00,360
in

13526
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:00,630
this

13527
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:00,780
in

13528
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:00,930
this

13529
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:01,560
position.

13530
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:02,190
But

13531
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:02,400
But

13532
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:02,700
without

13533
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:03,300
distraction

13534
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:03,690
and

13535
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:04,110
thinking.

13536
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:04,680
And

13537
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:04,920
so

13538
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,040
it's

13539
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:05,220
kind

13540
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:05,520
of a

13541
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:05,970
it's

13542
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:06,270
almost

13543
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:06,840
meditative

13544
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:06,960
in

13545
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,140
some

13546
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,410
ways,

13547
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:07,740
except

13548
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:08,100
it's

13549
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:08,430
not

13550
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,750
true

13551
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:10,410
meditation,

13552
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:11,040
but I

13553
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:11,190
am

13554
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:11,580
thinking

13555
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:11,760
while

13556
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,030
not

13557
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,540
moving,

13558
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:13,110
you're

13559
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,560
struggling.

13560
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:13,680
You're

13561
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:13,890
trying

13562
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:13,950
to

13563
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:14,400
structure

13564
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,550
your

13565
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:14,970
thoughts.

13566
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:15,150
Yeah.

13567
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:15,270
And

13568
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:15,420
that

13569
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:15,600
time,

13570
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:15,810
yeah.

13571
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,380
Interesting.

13572
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:16,770
Yeah.

13573
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:17,790
So

13574
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:17,970
but

13575
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:18,450
everybody,

13576
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:18,630

13578
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,020
say,

13579
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,040
is

13580
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,250
very

13581
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:20,640
different.

13582
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,180
And

13583
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:21,360
so

13584
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:21,540
with

13585
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:21,750
with

13586
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:22,350
ADHD,

13587
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:22,500
you

13588
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:22,980
have

13589
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:23,370
the

13590
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:23,550
key

13591
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:23,760
thing

13592
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:23,970
is we

13593
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:24,120

01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:24,330
make

13596
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:24,600
sure

13597
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:24,780
that

13598
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:24,960
this

13599
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:25,140
is

13600
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:25,590
present

13601
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:26,160
across

13602
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:26,700
different

13603
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:27,570
domains

13604
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:28,020
of

life,

13606
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,490
school

13607
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:29,730
and

13608
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:30,180
home,

13609
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:30,600
to

13610
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:30,780
show

13611
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:30,870
that

13612
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,930
it

13613
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,170
really

13614
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:31,320
is a

13615
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:31,890
pervasive

13616
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:32,460
pattern

13617
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:32,970
and

13618
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:33,150
not

13619
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:33,540
something

13620
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:34,200
specific

13621
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:34,440
to

13622
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:34,650
Oh,

13623
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:34,830
you

13624
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:34,920
know,

13625
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:35,040
the

13626
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:35,520
teacher

13627
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:35,610
or

13628
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:35,820
the

01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:37,200
something.

13633
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:38,190
And

13634
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:38,310
then

13635
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,400
you

13636
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:38,580

patients.

13639
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:39,360
It's

13640
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:39,810
interesting

13641
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:40,260
that

01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:44,010
on

13655
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:44,790
quantitative

13656
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,390
eg

13657
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:45,750
based

13658
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,590
diagnoses

13659
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:46,770
and

13660
01:22:46,770 --> 01:22:46,980
so

13661
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,160
there's

13662
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:47,610
some

13663
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,240
progress

13664
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:48,750
toward

13665
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:49,710
making

13666
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,040
a

13667
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,790
diagnosis

13668
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,120
with

13669
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:51,780
looking

13670
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:51,870
at

13671
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:52,650
particular

13672
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:53,400
externally

13673
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,030
detectable

13674
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:54,750
brainwave

13675
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,350
rhythms.

13676
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,500
So

13677
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,220
skullcap,

13678
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:56,520
some

13679
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,030
electrodes

13680
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,180
that

13681
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:57,390
don't

13682
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:57,810
penetrate

13683
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:57,900
the

13684
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,290
skull.

13685
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:58,440
That's

13686
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:58,620
right.

13687
01:22:58,950 --> 01:22:59,190
And

13688
01:22:59,190 --> 01:22:59,340
this

13689
01:22:59,340 --> 01:22:59,490
can

13690
01:22:59,490 --> 01:22:59,580
be

13691
01:22:59,580 --> 01:22:59,790
done

13692
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:00,150
in an

13693
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:00,600
hour,

13694
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:00,810
two

13695
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,020
hour

13696
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:01,620
session.

13697
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:01,890
That's

13698
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:01,980
what

13699
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,040
it

13700
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:02,250
has

13701
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:02,400
to be

13702
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:02,610
done

13703
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:02,910
in

13704
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:03,690
clinic,

13705
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:03,960
right?

13706
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,140
Yeah,

13707
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:04,260
in

13708
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:04,350
the

13709
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:04,680
clinic,

13710
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:04,920
right.

13711
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:05,070
You

13712
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:05,220
have

13713
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:05,310
to

13714
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:05,460
have

13715
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:05,520
the

13716
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:05,790
right

13717
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,420
recording

13718
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:07,020
apparatus

13719
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:07,140
and

13720
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:07,290
so

13721
01:23:07,290 --> 01:23:07,560
on.

13722
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:07,950
But,

13723
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:08,880
but

13724
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,180
but

13725
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:10,200
that's

13726
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:10,470
in

13727
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,070
principle,

13728
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:11,670
as

13729
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:11,820
you

13730
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:12,480
increasing

13731
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,020
confidence

13732
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:13,380
comes

13733
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:13,500
in

13734
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:14,130
exactly

13735
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:14,550
which

13736
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:15,390
measurements.

13737
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:17,100
One

13738
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,430
could

13739
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:17,880
even

13740
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:18,360
imagine

13741
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:18,630
moving

13742
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:19,080
toward,

13743
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,200
you

13744
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:19,320
know,

13745
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:19,620
home

13746
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,190
tests,

13747
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:20,640
but

13748
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:20,730
we're

13749
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:20,940
not

13750
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:21,120
there

13751
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:21,300
yet.

13752
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:22,830
Amazing.

13753
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:23,010
I

13754
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:23,340
think

13755
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:23,910
one

13756
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:24,000
of

13757
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:24,060
the

13758
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:24,270
reasons

13759
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:24,480
I get

13760
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:24,720
asked

13761
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:24,930
about

13762
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,110
it so

13763
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,290
much

13764
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:25,440
is a

13765
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:25,590
lot

13766
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,650
of

13767
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:25,860
people

13768
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:26,190
wonder

13769
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:26,310
if

13770
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,460
they

13771
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:26,670
have

13772
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:27,420
ADHD?

13773
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:28,110
Do

13774
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:28,200
you

13775
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:28,500
think

13776
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:28,740
that

13777
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:28,950
some

13778
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:29,100
of

13779
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,370
the

13780
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,210
lifestyle

13781
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:30,840
factors

13782
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,170
that

13783
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:32,970
inhabit

13784
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:33,120
us

13785
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:33,480
all

13786
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,750
these

13787
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,200
days

13788
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:34,800
could

13789
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,190
induce

13790
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:35,370
a

13791
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:36,030
subclinical

13792
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:36,240
or a

13793
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:36,870
clinical

13794
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:37,530
like,

13795
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,270
ADHD

13796
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:39,690
meaning

13797
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,740
if I

13798
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:40,950
look

13799
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:41,040
at

13800
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:41,310
people's

13801
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:41,550
phone

13802
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:41,790
use,

13803
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:42,150
including

13804
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:42,330
my

13805
01:23:42,330 --> 01:23:42,660
own

13806
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:42,960
and I

13807
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,170
don't

13808
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:43,410
think

13809
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:43,710
of it

13810
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:43,950
like

13811
01:23:43,950 --> 01:23:44,490
addiction,

13812
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:44,640
it

13813
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:44,970
looks

13814
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:45,330
to me

13815
01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:45,450
and

13816
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:45,780
feels

13817
01:23:45,780 --> 01:23:45,990
to be

13818
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,200
more

13819
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:46,440
like

13820
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,100
OCD.

13821
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:47,220
And

13822
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:47,340
I'll

13823
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,550
come

13824
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:47,790
clean

13825
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:47,910
here

13826
01:23:47,910 --> 01:23:48,060
by

13827
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:48,210
saying

13828
01:23:48,210 --> 01:23:48,360
when

13829
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:48,600
I was

13830
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:48,960
younger,

13831
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,080
when

13832
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:49,230
I was

13833
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:49,260
a

13834
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:49,440
kid,

13835
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:49,680
I had

13836
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:49,740
a

13837
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,340
grunting

13838
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:50,940
tick.

13839
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:51,450
I

13840
01:23:51,450 --> 01:23:51,630
used

13841
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:51,690
to

13842
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:52,020
hide

13843
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:52,110
it

13844
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:52,410
actually

13845
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:52,560
used

13846
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:52,620
to

13847
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:52,890
hide

13848
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:52,980
in

13849
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:53,040
the

13850
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:53,490
closet

13851
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:53,670
because

13852
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:53,940
my

13853
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,300
dad

13854
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:54,420
would

13855
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:54,600
make

13856
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:54,750
me

13857
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:55,260
stop.

13858
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:56,340
And I

13859
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:56,610
used

13860
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,240
to, I

13861
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:57,540
couldn't

13862
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:57,900
feel

13863
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,110
any

13864
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:58,530
relief

13865
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:58,770
of my

13866
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,190
mind

13867
01:23:59,190 --> 01:23:59,460
until

13868
01:23:59,460 --> 01:23:59,580
I

13869
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:00,240
would

13870
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:00,330
do

13871
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:00,510
this.

13872
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:00,780
And

13873
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:01,110
actually

13874
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,470
now

13875
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:01,680
if I

13876
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:01,860
get

13877
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:02,130
very

13878
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:02,700
tired,

13879
01:24:02,850 --> 01:24:02,970
and

13880
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,030
if

13881
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,180
I've

13882
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,300
been

13883
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:03,600
pushing

13884
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:03,840
long

13885
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,080
hours,

13886
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:04,260
it'll

13887
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:04,470
come

13888
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,920
back.

13889
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:05,820
I was

13890
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:05,970
not

13891
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:06,330
treated

13892
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:06,600
for

13893
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:06,840
it.

13894
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:08,550
But I

13895
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:08,730
will

13896
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:09,420
confess

13897
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,020
that

13898
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:10,260
I've

13899
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:10,410
had

13900
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:10,530
the

13901
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:11,220
experience

13902
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:11,850
of I

13903
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:12,090
always

13904
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:12,360
liked

13905
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:12,870
sports

13906
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,140
where

13907
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:13,320
I

13908
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:13,740
involve

13909
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:13,980
a lot

13910
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:14,040
of

13911
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:14,460
impact,

13912
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:14,820
fortunately,

13913
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,120
not

13914
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:15,870
football,

13915
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,290
because

13916
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:16,350
I

13917
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:16,500
went

13918
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:16,590
to

13919
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:16,740
high

13920
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:16,950
school

13921
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:17,040
where

13922
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:17,130
the

13923
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:17,430
football

13924
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:17,610
team

13925
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:17,760
was

13926
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,270
terrible.

13927
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:18,660
Maybe

13928
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:18,780
that

13929
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:18,900
would

13930
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:18,960
have

13931
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,380
avoided

13932
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:19,560
more

13933
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,070
impact.

13934
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:20,460
But

13935
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:20,670
things

13936
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:20,790
like

13937
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:21,540
skateboarding,

13938
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,260
boxing,

13939
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:23,310
they

13940
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:23,640
bring

13941
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,240
relief.

13942
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:24,750
I

13943
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,020
feel

13944
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:25,740
clarity,

13945
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,250
laughter

13946
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:26,310
a

13947
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,550
head

13948
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:26,730
hit

13949
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:26,910
which

13950
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:27,000
I

13951
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,570
avoid,

13952
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:28,320
but

13953
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:28,920
but I

13954
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,130
used

13955
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:29,220
to

13956
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:29,370
say

13957
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:29,580
that's

13958
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:29,640
the

13959
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:29,850
only

13960
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:30,090
time

13961
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:30,180
I

13962
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:30,420
feel

13963
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:30,810
truly

13964
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:31,320
clear

13965
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,560
for a

13966
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:31,740
lot

13967
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:31,830
and

13968
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,980
then

13969
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:32,430
eventually

13970
01:24:32,430 --> 01:24:32,550
it

13971
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,150
dissipated

13972
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:33,420
by

13973
01:24:33,420 --> 01:24:33,750
about

13974
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,990
age

13975
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,800
1617

13976
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,010
just

13977
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:35,610
disappeared.

13978
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:36,630
Um,

13979
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,290
so I

13980
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:37,410
have

13981
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:37,830
great

13982
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:38,670
empathy

13983
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:38,880
for

13984
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,120
those

13985
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:39,330
that

13986
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:39,930
feel

13987
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:40,290
like

13988
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:40,500
there's

13989
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:40,860
something

13990
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:41,370
contained

13991
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:41,460
in

13992
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:41,610
them

13993
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:41,790
that

13994
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:42,000
won't

13995
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,270
allow

13996
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:42,420
them

13997
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:42,510
to

13998
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:42,870
focus

13999
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:42,960
on

14000
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:43,110
what

14001
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,200
they

14002
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:43,410
want

14003
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:43,470
to

14004
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:43,830
focus

14005
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,040
on.

14006
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:44,850
And

14007
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:45,090
these

14008
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:45,630
days

14009
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:45,870
with

14010
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:45,930
the

14011
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:46,500
phone

14012
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:46,800
and

14013
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:47,130
and

14014
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:47,370
all

14015
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:47,730
these

14016
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:48,240
emails,

14017
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:48,720
etc.

14018
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:49,680
I

14019
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:50,430
wonder

14020
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:51,330
and I

14021
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:52,170
empathize

14022
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:52,380
a bit

14023
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,500
when

14024
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:52,560
I

14025
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:52,740
hear

14026
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:52,980
people

14027
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:53,250
saying

14028
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:53,610
like,

14029
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:54,780
I

14030
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:55,020
think

14031
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:55,080
I

14032
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:55,290
might

14033
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:55,470
have

14034
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:56,070
ADHD

14035
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,280
or a

14036
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,750
DD Do

14037
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:57,870
you

14038
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:58,110
think

14039
01:24:58,110 --> 01:24:58,230
it's

14040
01:24:58,230 --> 01:24:58,770
possible

14041
01:24:58,770 --> 01:24:59,160
that

14042
01:24:59,310 --> 01:24:59,520
our

14043
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,000
behavior

14044
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,330
And

14045
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:00,450
our

14046
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:01,140
interaction

14047
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:01,260
with

14048
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:01,320
the

14049
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:01,830
sensory

14050
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,280
world,

14051
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:02,760
which

14052
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:02,880
is

14053
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:03,060
really

14054
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:03,210
what

14055
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:03,570
phones

14056
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:03,660
and

14057
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:03,960
email

14058
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:04,230
really

14059

01:26:20,099 --> 01:26:20,189
the

14264
01:26:20,189 --> 01:26:20,669
world

14265
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:21,299
of

14266
01:26:21,329 --> 01:26:21,659
today.

14267
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:22,380
Yeah,

14268
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:22,860
opting

14269
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:23,250
out

14270
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:23,460
of

14271
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:24,060

14272
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:24,360
now

14273
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,720
makes

14274
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:24,960
it

14275
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:25,800
makes

14276
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,160
you

14277
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:26,400
in

14278
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:26,550
some

14279
01:26:26,550 --> 01:26:26,730
ways,

14280
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:26,970
less

14281
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:27,420
adaptive,

14282
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:27,840
though,

14283
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:28,050
I

14284
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:28,350
would

14285
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:29,010
point

14286
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:29,070
to

14287
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:29,190
you

14288
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:29,400
as an

14289
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:29,820
example

14290
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:29,880
of

14291
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,210
somebody

14292
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:30,480
who

14293
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:31,680
is

14294
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:31,950
quite

14295
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:32,160
good

14296
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:32,250
at

14297
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:32,790
managing

14298
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:33,180
his

14299
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:34,500
interactions,

14300
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:34,620
at

14301
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:34,800
least

14302
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:35,010
from

14303
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:35,310
from

14304
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:35,400
the

14305
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:35,880
outsider

14306
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:36,420
perspective,

14307
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:37,110
I do

14308
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,290
want

14309
01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:37,350
to

14310
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,710
ask

14311
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:38,220
you a

14312
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:38,400
little

14313
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:38,520
bit

14314
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:38,850
about

14315
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,360
you.

14316
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:40,080
And

14317
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:41,640
first

14318
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:41,730
of

14319
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:42,150
all,

14320
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:43,290
and I

14321
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:43,620
realize

14322
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:43,770
this

14323
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:43,890
is

14324
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:44,100
only

14325
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:44,160
a

14326
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:44,610
partial

14327
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:44,940
list,

14328
01:26:44,940 --> 01:26:45,360
but

14329
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,170
your

14330
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:46,620
clinician,

14331
01:26:46,620 --> 01:26:46,740
you

14332
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:46,890
see

14333
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:47,610
patients,

14334
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:48,270
you

14335
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:48,510
run a

14336
01:26:48,510 --> 01:26:48,720
big

14337
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,230
laboratory,

14338
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:49,350
how

14339
01:26:49,350 --> 01:26:49,500
many

14340
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:49,740
people

14341
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:49,830
are

14342
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:49,890

14343
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:50,010
your

14344
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:50,490
laboratory?

14345
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:50,820
Now?

14346
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,080
That's

14347
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:52,140
a

14348
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:52,590
huge

14349
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:53,280
laboratory.

14350
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:54,060
from

14351
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:54,480
experience,

14352
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:54,720
I can

14353
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:54,840
say

14354
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:55,170
that's,

14355
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:55,470
that's

14356
01:26:55,470 --> 01:26:55,590

laboratory.

14359
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:58,710
You

14360
01:26:58,710 --> 01:26:58,770
have

14361
01:26:58,770 --> 01:26:58,830

14366
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:01,170
And

14369
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,070

14381
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,320
How,

14382
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:10,680
how

14383
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:10,800
do

14384
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,220
you

14385
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,030

level,

14391
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:14,190
the

14392
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:14,670
day

14393
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:15,000
in

14394
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,090
the

14395
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:15,570
week?

14396
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:16,920
And I

14397
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:17,130
should

14398
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:17,520
say,

14399
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:18,630
what

14400
01:27:18,630 --> 01:27:19,050
stress

14401
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:19,650
mitigation

14402
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,310
practices,

14403
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,430
if

14404
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:20,760
any,

14405
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:20,880
do

14406
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,000
you

14407
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,660
incorporate?

14408
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:21,900
I've

14409
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:22,230
received

14410
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:22,590
emails

14411
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:22,740
from

14412
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:22,890
you

14413
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:22,980
at

14414
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:23,220
three

14415
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:23,310
in

14416
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:23,370
the

14417
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:23,820
morning.

14418
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:24,690
I

14419
01:27:24,690 --> 01:27:25,110
sometimes

14420
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,290
send

14421
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:25,590
emails

14422
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:25,650
at

14423
01:27:25,650 --> 01:27:25,770
three

14424
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:25,830
in

14425
01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:25,890
the

14426
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:26,070
morning,

14427
01:27:26,070 --> 01:27:26,160
but

14428
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:26,370
that's

14429
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:26,520
when

14430
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:26,580
I

14431
01:27:26,580 --> 01:27:26,880
wake

14432
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:27,240
up,

14433
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:27,630
maybe

14434
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:27,750
I'm

14435
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,260
depressed.

14436
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:28,440
And

14437
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:28,680
but I

14438
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:28,830
go

14439
01:27:28,830 --> 01:27:29,040
back

14440
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,160
to

14441
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:29,580
sleep.

14442
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:30,420
So

14443
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:30,690
maybe

14444
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:30,780
you

14445
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:30,990
just

14446
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:31,560
describe

14447
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:32,160

01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:33,750
the

14452
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:34,440

01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:34,530
the

14454
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:34,680
day,

14455
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:34,920
not

14456
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:35,160

14457
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:35,340

01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,420

what

14464
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,470
are

14465
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:37,590
in

14466
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:37,830
those

14467
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:38,250
blocks.

14468
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:38,520
But

14469
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,030
how

14470
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,090
do

14471
01:27:39,090 --> 01:27:39,210
you

14472
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,260
conceptualize

14473
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:40,380
the

14474
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:40,890
day?

14475
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:41,340
How

14476
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:41,430
do

14477
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,520
you

14478
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,390
conceptualize

14479
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:42,510
the

14480
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:43,020
weak?

14481
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,190
And

14482
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:45,570
how

14483
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:45,750
do

14484
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,900
you

14485
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,200
feel

14486
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:46,530
about

14487
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:46,680
how

14488
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:47,100
that's

14489
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:47,790
lined

14490
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:47,940
up

14491
01:27:47,940 --> 01:27:48,150
with

14492
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:48,390
your,

14493
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:48,600
your

14494
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:48,990
larger

14495
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:49,380
goals

14496
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:49,890
of

14497
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:50,460
making

14498
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:50,640
sure

14499
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:50,850
these

14500
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:51,270
five

14501
01:27:51,870 --> 01:27:52,320
young

14502
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,740
people,

14503
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:52,980
you

14504
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,160
know,

14505
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:53,850
flourish?

14506
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,120
Which

14507
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:54,240
I

14508
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:54,450
hear

14509
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:54,630
they

14510
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:54,990
are?

14511
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:56,520
But

14512
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:57,030
how

14513
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:57,090
do

14514
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:57,180
you

14515
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:57,330
go

14516
01:27:57,330 --> 01:27:57,690
about

14517
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:58,050
this?

14518
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:58,590
What

14519
01:27:58,590 --> 01:27:58,770
for

14520
01:27:58,770 --> 01:27:59,010
most

14521
01:27:59,010 --> 01:27:59,280
people

14522
01:27:59,280 --> 01:27:59,400
would

14523
01:27:59,400 --> 01:27:59,610
just

14524
01:27:59,610 --> 01:27:59,880
be an

14525
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,720
overwhelming

14526
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:01,050
set

14527
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:01,530
of of

14528
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:02,010
items?

14529
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,700
Well,

14530
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:03,000
it's

14531
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,100
a, of

14532
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,520
course,

14533
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:06,180
it's

14534
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:06,720
sometimes

14535
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:06,810
it's

14536
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:07,170
just

14537
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:07,650
take

14538
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:07,740
it

14539
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:07,890
day

14540
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:08,040
by

14541
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:08,370
day.

14542
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:08,610
And

14543
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:09,090
and,

14544
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:09,780
and

14545
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:10,470
so I

14546
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:10,800
don't

14547
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,040
claim

14548
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:11,100
to

14549
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:11,340
bring

14550
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:11,400
the

14551
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,880
horizon

14552
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:12,150
into

14553
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:12,210
the

14554
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:12,510
unit

14555
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:12,600
of

14556
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:12,690
the

14557
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:13,080
day.

14558
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,310
I do.

14559
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:14,760
I do.

14560
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,030
It's

14561
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,240
it,

14562
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:15,300
the

14563
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:15,570
unit

14564
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:15,690
is

14565
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:15,810
the

14566
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:16,110
day.

14567
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:16,380
That's

14568
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:16,710
right.

14569
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:17,370
And

14570
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,080
what

14571
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,190
I, I

14572
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:20,430
try

14573
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:20,520
to

14574
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:20,790
have

14575
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:20,880
in

14576
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,060
each

14577
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:21,480
day,

14578
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:22,050
as I

14579
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:22,380
mentioned

14580
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:22,680
earlier,

14581
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,280
some

14582
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:23,430
at

14583
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,790
least

14584
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:23,910
an

14585
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:24,270
hour

14586
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:24,480
of

14587
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:24,960
time

14588
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:25,110
where

14589
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,560
I can

14590
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:25,950
think

14591
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,030
and

14592
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:27,360
that

14593
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:27,540
can

14594
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:27,930
be it

14595
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:28,050
can

14596
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:28,170
be

14597
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:28,500
when

14598
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:28,800
kids

14599
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:28,890
are

14600
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:29,550
napping,

14601
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:29,670
it

14602
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:29,850
can

14603
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:30,270
be

14604
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:31,470
you

14605
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:31,770
know,

14606
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:32,520
actually

14607
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:32,850
because

14608
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:33,030
I

14609
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:33,450
while

14610
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:33,840
driving,

14611
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,110
I can

14612
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:34,230
do

14613
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:34,440
that

14614
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:34,860
too,

14615
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:35,430
because

14616
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:35,550
I'm

14617
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:35,850
sitting

14618
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:36,240
still.

14619
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,400
But

14620
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:40,170
that

14621
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:40,530
that's

14622
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:40,770
the

14623
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:41,010
one

14624
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:41,190
thing

14625
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:41,280
I

14626
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:41,520
tried

14627
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:41,580
to

14628
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,180
preserve.

14629
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,480
When

14630
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:42,690
I was

14631
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:42,960
writing

14632
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,050
the

14633
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:43,410
book,

14634
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:43,830
I

14635
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,370
adapted

14636
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:44,610
that

14637
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:45,030
time

14638
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:45,300
to be

14639
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:46,140
my

14640
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:46,650
writing

14641
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:46,980
time,

14642
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:47,100
but

14643
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:47,190
it

14644
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:47,490
wasn't

14645
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:48,000
enough.

14646
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:48,900
It's

14647
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,110
you

14648
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,410
know,

14649
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,580
so I

14650
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:50,730
had

14651
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:50,820
to

14652
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:51,060
add

14653
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:51,210
in a

14654
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:51,450

14655
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:51,780

14656
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:51,870
of

14657
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:52,170
time,

14658
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:52,320
which

14659
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,710
was

14660
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:52,980
sort

14661
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:53,190
of

14662
01:28:54,030 --> 01:28:54,510
midnight

14663
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:54,630
to

14664
01:28:54,630 --> 01:28:55,320
2am

14665
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:55,740
writing

14666
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,190

just

14832
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:04,500

01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,570
Your

14842
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,530

14843
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:08,730
Are

14844
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:08,910

14850
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:11,970
although

14851
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:12,090

14854
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:13,260
so

14855
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:13,470
you're

14856
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:13,890
actually

yourself?

14861
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:15,630
Yes.

14862
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:16,080
And

01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:17,880
not

14868
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,090
quite

14869
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:18,330
literal,

14870
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:18,390
I

14871
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:18,630
don't

14872
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:18,960
actually

14873
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:19,200
hear

14874
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:19,290
a

14875
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:19,860
foundation,

14876
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:20,460
but I

14877
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:20,640
am

14878
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:20,970
hearing

14879
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:21,480
words.

14880
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,710
And

14881
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:22,920
so

14882
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:23,130
it's,

14883
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:24,180
um, I

14884
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:24,630
discovered

14885
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:24,810
this

14886
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:25,080
about

14887
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,560
myself,

14888
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:25,770
other

14889
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:26,280
people,

14890
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:26,700
I

14891
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,030
think,

14892
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:27,180
you

14893
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:27,270
know,

14894
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,420
may

14895
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:27,930
operate

14896
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,610
differently,

14897
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:29,880
but

14898
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:30,510
I'm

14899
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:31,110
extremely

14900
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,500
verbal

14901
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:31,620
and

14902
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:31,950
how I

14903
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:32,310
think

14904
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,520
that's

14905
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:32,700
how

14906
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:32,850
all

14907
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,060
my

14908
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:33,450
reasoning

14909
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:33,600
is

14910
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:33,870
done.

14911
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:34,020
It's

14912
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,200
with

14913
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:34,980
sentences

14914
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:35,250
and

14915
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:36,420
construction

14916
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:36,780
of,

14917
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:37,830
of,

14918
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:38,520
you

14919
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:38,730
know,

14920
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,600
almost

14921
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,170
equations

14922
01:30:40,170 --> 01:30:40,320
with

14923
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:40,800
words,

14924
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:41,550
complete

14925
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,120
sentences,

14926
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:42,660
complete

14927
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:43,230
sentences

14928
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:43,440
are

14929
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:43,830
complete

14930
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,040
ish,

14931
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:44,550
anyway,

14932
01:30:44,910 --> 01:30:45,300
mostly

14933
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:45,780
complete.

14934
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,020
And

14935
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:46,410
then

14936
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,830
in

14937
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:46,950
when

14938
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:47,220
writing

14939
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:47,310
the

14940
01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:47,730
book,

14941
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,270
everything

14942
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:48,660
about

14943
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:48,960
the

14944
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:49,470
writing,

14945
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:49,560
I

14946
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:49,710
would

14947
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,460
always

14948
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:50,850
every

14949
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,750
sentence

14950
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:52,500
was

14951
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:52,890
always

14952
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:53,250
played

14953
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:53,430
out,

14954
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:53,670
in my

14955
01:30:53,670 --> 01:30:54,150
mind

14956
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:54,660
listening

14957
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:55,200
for

14958
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:55,710
rhythm

14959
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:56,010
and

14960
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:56,820
timing.

14961
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:57,930
And I

14962
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:58,080
would

14963
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:58,530
obsess

14964
01:30:58,530 --> 01:30:59,160
over

14965
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,120
exact

14966
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:00,570
placement

14967
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:00,750
of

14968
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:01,290
words

14969
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:01,380
to

14970
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:01,560
get

14971
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:01,650
the

14972
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:01,950
right

14973
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:02,340
rhythm

14974
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:02,460
of

14975
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:02,610
the

14976
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,060
spoken

14977
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:03,480
sentence

14978
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:03,840
in my

14979
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:04,140
in my

14980
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,440
mind,

14981
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:04,470
I

14982
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:04,890
could

14983
01:31:04,890 --> 01:31:05,130
I

14984
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:05,370
don't

14985
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:05,520
mean

14986
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:05,640
to

14987
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:06,000
interrupt

14988
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:06,120
your

14989
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:06,360
flow.

14990
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,600
But

14991
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:07,170
when

14992
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:07,350
you

14993
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,560
do

14994
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,010
that,

14995
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,220
and

14996
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:08,460
having

14997
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:09,180
experienced

14998
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:09,480
this

14999
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:09,990
process

15000
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,020
a

15001
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:10,260
bit,

15002
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:10,590
although

15003
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:11,490
differently,

15004
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:12,600
do

15005
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:12,780
you

15006
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,320
experience

15007
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:13,530
any

15008
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:13,680
kind

15009
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:13,740
of

15010
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:14,070
welling

15011
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,640
up of

15012
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,210
anxiety

15013
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:15,420
when

15014
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:15,600
you're

15015
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:15,930
hitting

15016
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:16,230
the

01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:16,530

friction

15019
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:17,520
points?

15020
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:18,660
And

15021
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:18,810
if

15022
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:19,080
so,

15023
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:19,200
do

15024
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:19,350
you

15025
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:19,890
have

15026
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:20,460
tools

15027
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:20,820
or

15028
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:21,570
ways

15029
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:21,690
that

15030
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:21,810
you

15031
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:22,200
quell

15032
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:22,380
that

15033
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,010

01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:23,430
real

15036
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:23,910
time,

15037
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:24,210
because

15038
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:24,360
what

15039
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:24,450
we're

15040
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:24,690
really

15041
01:31:24,690 --> 01:31:25,020
talking

15042
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,260
about

01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:25,530
here

15044
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:25,770
is

15045
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:26,490
your

15046
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:26,940
mind.

15047
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:27,360
But

15048
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:27,690
what

15049
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:27,780
we're

15050
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:27,990
really

01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:28,500
is

15054
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:28,680
this

01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:29,310
of,

15057
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:29,970
of

15058
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:30,930
converting

15059
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,530
the

15063
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:33,720
into

15064
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,290
something

15065
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:34,770
physically

15066
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:35,340

world.

15070
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:36,420
And

15071
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:36,570
these

15072
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:37,200
intermediate

15073
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:37,650
steps

15074
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:37,770
are

15075
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:38,010
so

15076
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:38,790
mysterious

15077
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:38,970
to

15078
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:39,510
everybody

15079
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:39,690
we

15080
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:39,960
hear,

15081
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:40,110
you

15082
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:40,230
know,

15083
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:40,560
just

15084
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:40,770
write

15085
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:40,860
the

15086
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:41,130
book,

15087
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:41,400
just

15088
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:41,610
do

15089
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:41,850
it,

15090
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:42,570
whatever

15091
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:42,840
that

15092
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:43,200
means.

15093
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:43,290
In

15094
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:43,590
fact,

15095
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,040
statements

15096
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:44,190
like

15097
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:44,340
that,

15098
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:44,490
to me

15099
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:44,580
are

15100
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:44,700
kind

15101
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:44,790
of

15102
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:45,090
empty

15103
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:45,180
and

15104
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:45,780
meaningless.

15105
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:47,580
But

15106
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:48,510
when

15107
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:48,630
you

15108
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:48,870
hear

15109
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:49,020
your

15110
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:49,410
voice,

15111
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:49,560
and

15112
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:49,890
you're

15113
01:31:49,950 --> 01:31:50,310
trying

15114
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,370
to

15115
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:50,670
find

15116
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:50,760
the

15117
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:51,180
correct

15118
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:51,570
word,

15119
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:51,780
and

15120
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,110
you

15121
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:52,500
keep

15122
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:52,980
hitting

15123
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:53,940
the

15124
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,420
doesn't

15125
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:54,810
sound

15126
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:55,140
quite

15127
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:55,560
right,

15128
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:55,920
what

15129
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,040
is

15130
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:56,160
the

15131
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,820
experience

15132
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:56,940
in

15133
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,090
your

15134
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:57,600
body?

15135
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,440
Yeah,

15136
01:31:58,470 --> 01:31:58,830
I

15137
01:31:58,920 --> 01:31:59,190
went,

15138
01:31:59,190 --> 01:31:59,340
it's

15139
01:31:59,370 --> 01:31:59,640
not

15140
01:31:59,640 --> 01:31:59,970
right.

15141
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,270
It's

15142
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:00,810
definitely

15143
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:01,890
it's

15144
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,640
versiv.

15145
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,150
It

15146
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:03,390
doesn't

15147
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:03,930
feel

15148
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:04,860
good.

15149
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:06,060
But

15150
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:06,210
it's

15151
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:06,630
not.

15152
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:07,350
But I

15153
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:07,560
but

15154
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:07,710
there's

15155
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:08,220
also

15156
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:08,310
a

15157
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:08,580
hope,

15158
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:08,820
because

15159
01:32:08,820 --> 01:32:08,910
I

15160
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:09,090
know

15161
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,360
I can

15162
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:09,660
solve

15163
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:09,810
it

15164
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:10,140
too.

15165
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:10,620
And,

15166
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:10,890
and

15167
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:11,100
so

15168
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:11,580
there's,

15169
01:32:11,610 --> 01:32:11,940
there's

15170
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:12,270
this

15171
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:14,430
it's

15172
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:14,730
almost

15173
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:14,970
like

15174
01:32:14,970 --> 01:32:15,240
you're

15175
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:15,390
you're

15176
01:32:15,390 --> 01:32:15,690
almost

15177
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:16,050
there,

15178
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:16,200
you

15179
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:16,350
know,

15180
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:16,560
you've

15181
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:16,830
there's

15182
01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:17,100
a

15183
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:17,520
path

15184
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:17,640
that

15185
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:17,730
you

15186
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:17,970
know,

15187
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:18,090
is

15188
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:18,450
there.

15189
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:19,500
You

15190
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:19,620
don't

15191
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:19,860
quite

15192
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:20,130
see

15193
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:20,340
it.

15194
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:21,240
But

15195
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,050
it's

15196
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:22,410
there.

15197
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:22,740
And

15198
01:32:22,740 --> 01:32:23,160
and I

15199
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:23,430
keep

15200
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,640
that

15201
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:23,730
in

15202
01:32:23,730 --> 01:32:24,150
mind.

15203
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:24,330
And

15204
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:24,540
so

15205
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:24,900
there's

15206
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:25,140
there's

15207
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:25,230
a

15208
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:25,590
there's

15209
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:25,830
a

15210
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:26,820
there's

15211
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,090
this

15212
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:28,350
propulsive

15213
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:28,680
force

15214
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,160
forward?

15215
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:29,940
Because

15216
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:30,030
I

15217
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:30,240
know

15218
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:30,450
that

15219
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:30,570
the

15220
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:31,020
solution

15221
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:31,140
is

15222
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:31,500
there.

15223
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:31,860
And

15224
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:32,550
and

15225
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:32,700
that

15226
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:32,940
said,

15227
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:33,120
I,

15228
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:33,300
you

15229
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:33,450
know,

15230
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:33,600
there

15231
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,050
were,

15232
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:35,400
there

15233
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:35,730
were

15234
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:36,180
single

15235
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:36,660
words

15236
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:36,870
that

15237
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:37,080
would,

15238
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:38,070
I

15239
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,220
would

15240
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:38,490
spend

15241
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:38,850
days

15242
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,240
on,

15243
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:39,420
you

15244
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:39,570
know,

15245
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:39,930
because

15246
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:40,350
I was

15247
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:40,680
just

15248
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:40,860
not

15249
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:41,190
happy

15250
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:41,700
until

15251
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:42,000
I got

15252
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,090
it

15253
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:42,360
right.

15254
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:42,660
And

15255
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:42,750
there

15256
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:42,840
were

15257
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:43,050
some

15258
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:43,380
things

15259
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:43,590
that

15260
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:43,740
I

15261
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:44,370
never

15262
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:44,790
quite

15263
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:45,030
got

15264
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:45,420
perfect.

15265
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:45,510
And

15266
01:32:45,510 --> 01:32:45,690
so I

15267
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:45,960
left

15268
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,140
out

15269
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:46,230
of

15270
01:32:46,230 --> 01:32:46,320
the

15271
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:46,560
book

15272
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,100
entirely,

15273
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:47,580
because

15274
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:47,730
it

15275
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:47,910
was

15276
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,150
so

15277
01:32:48,150 --> 01:32:48,750
close,

15278
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:49,230
but

15279
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:49,590
not

15280
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:49,860
not

15281
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:50,130
quite

15282
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:50,430
there.

15283
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:50,610
And

15284
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:51,150
so I

15285
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:51,630
was

15286
01:32:51,630 --> 01:32:51,750
like,

15287
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:51,960
No, I

15288
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,230
can't

15289
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:52,380
put

15290
01:32:52,380 --> 01:32:52,530
that

15291
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:52,740
in.

15292
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:53,940
everything

15293
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:54,030
you

15294
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:54,180
just

15295
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:54,330
said

15296
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:54,450
is

15297
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:54,870
entirely

15298
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:55,470
consistent

15299
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:55,620
with

15300
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:55,800
my

15301
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:56,400
experience

15302
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:56,550
of

15303
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,910
you.

15304
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:58,530
And

15305
01:32:58,530 --> 01:32:58,590
the

15306
01:32:58,590 --> 01:32:58,800
way

15307
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:58,920
you

15308
01:32:58,920 --> 01:32:59,100
go

15309
01:32:59,100 --> 01:32:59,520
about

15310
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:00,960
everything

15311
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:01,170
I

15312
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:01,320
have

15313
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:01,380
to

15314
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:01,560
ask

15315
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:02,220

15322

and

15323
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:04,200
words

15324
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:04,620
and

15325
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:05,160
poetry.

15326
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:05,520
I

15327
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:05,730

on to

15335
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:07,710
a

15336
01:33:07,710 --> 01:33:07,980
career

15337
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:08,070
in

15338
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,520

15339
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:08,610
and

15340
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:09,090
science.

15341
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:09,539
Yeah,

15342
01:33:09,569 --> 01:33:09,989
they're

15343
01:33:09,989 --> 01:33:10,199

15344
01:33:10,199 --> 01:33:10,559
different,

15347
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,669

15348
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:11,969

15351
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:12,779
think

15352
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:12,929
do

15353
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:13,139

15355
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:14,369
appreciation,

15356
01:33:14,429 --> 01:33:14,639
or a

15357
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:14,789

15362
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:17,459
But

15363
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:18,179

It's

15388
01:33:27,569 --> 01:33:28,349

15409
01:33:37,049 --> 01:33:37,469
happy

15410
01:33:37,469 --> 01:33:37,769
except

15411
01:33:37,769 --> 01:33:38,069

15412
01:33:38,099 --> 01:33:38,249

01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:40,529
it's

01:33:40,529 --> 01:33:40,769

15428
01:33:42,629 --> 01:33:42,779
but I

15429
01:33:42,779 --> 01:33:43,019

15478
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:03,330
we

15479
01:34:03,330 --> 01:34:03,720
are

15480
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:04,170
really

15481
01:34:04,170 --> 01:34:04,500
trained

15482
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:04,590
to

15483
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:05,010
do.

15484
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:05,730
Like

15485
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:05,940
many

15486
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:06,480
professions

15487
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:06,570
were

15488
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:06,810
taught

15489
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:06,960
to

15490
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:07,260

15491
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,440
in

15492
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:07,530
and

15493
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:07,770
just

15494
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:08,070
get

15495
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,340

01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:08,970
motion.

15497
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:09,300
And

15498
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:09,540
and I

15499
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:09,780
found

15500
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:09,930

15501
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:10,170
very

15502
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:10,710
relaxing,

15503
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:10,800
and

15504
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,010
someone

15505
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:11,100
who

15506
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:11,400
probably

15507
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:11,610

01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:14,100
It

15516
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:14,310
felt

15517
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,640
great

15518
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:14,910

One

15522
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:15,510

professor

15531
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:18,270
and

15532
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:18,570
running

15533
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:18,900
a lab

15534
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:19,050
was

15535
01:34:19,050 --> 01:34:19,140
that

15536
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:19,860
I no

15537
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:20,160
longer

15538
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,430

01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:21,270
hands.

15542
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:21,960
And I

15543
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:22,290
felt

15544
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:22,440
like

15545
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,010
I was

15546
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:23,430
I

15547
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:24,510
felt

15548
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:24,780
like

15549
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,350
some

15550
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:25,710
big

15551
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,130
important

15552
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:26,280
part

15553
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:26,460
of my

15554
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:26,640
life

15555
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:26,730
had

15556
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:26,880
been

15557
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,660
amputated.

15558
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:28,500
But

15559
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:28,770
what

15560
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:29,010

15563
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:29,700
do

15564
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:29,760
you

15565
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,540
incorporate

15566
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,110
there?

15567
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,260
And

15568
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:31,350
do

15569
01:34:31,350 --> 01:34:31,410
you

15570
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:31,830
think

15571
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:33,450
people

15572
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:33,630
can

15573
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:34,050
learn

15574
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:34,170
to

15575
01:34:34,170 --> 01:34:34,350
get

15576
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:34,710
better

01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:34,830
at

01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:35,910
through

01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:36,030
a

15583
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:37,650
of

15584
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:37,740
the

15585
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:37,980

15586
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,070

I

15590
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:40,620
think,

01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,020
days

15617
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:52,950

15623
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,990
has

15624
01:34:54,990 --> 01:34:55,500
returned

15625
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:55,860
mostly

15626
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,010
to

01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,030
again,

15630
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,390
and

15631
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:57,630
so

15632
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:57,930
it's

15633
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:58,110
it's

15634
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:58,290
kind

15635
01:34:58,290 --> 01:34:58,380

15639
01:34:59,280 --> 01:34:59,700
I was

15640
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,420
So

15641
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:03,510
it's

15642
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:03,570
a

15643
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:03,870

15645
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:04,620
I

15646
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:04,950

01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:05,250
you

15648
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:05,460

01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,090
embrace

15652
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:06,330
that,

15653
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:06,660

15654
01:35:06,660 --> 01:35:07,080
different

15655
01:35:07,110 --> 01:35:07,560

15656
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:07,680
of

15657
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:07,920
life

15658
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:08,130
come

15659
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:08,370
with

15660
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:08,610
with

15661
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:08,910
different

15662
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:09,240
modes,

15663
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:09,390
but

15664
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:09,510
you

15665
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:09,660
can

15666
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:09,990
definitely

15667
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,230

15668
01:35:10,230 --> 01:35:10,680
yourself

15669
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:10,800
for

15670
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:10,980
each

15671
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,250
mode.

15672
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:11,520
I was

15673
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:11,970
not,

15674
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:13,200

15677
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,420

the,

15679
01:35:16,830 --> 01:35:17,040
as I

15680
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:17,460
mentioned

15681
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:18,360
the

15682
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:18,870
rhythm

15683
01:35:18,870 --> 01:35:19,440
of

15684
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:20,040
sewing

15685
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:20,790
and

15686
01:35:20,790 --> 01:35:21,270
suturing

15687
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,720
and

15688
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,380
surgery.

15689
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,180
And I

15690
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:24,570
worked

15691
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:24,780
really

15692
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:25,050
hard

15693
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:25,200
on

15694
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:25,560
that

15695
01:35:25,590 --> 01:35:25,860
and

15696
01:35:25,860 --> 01:35:26,520
became,

15697
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,700
you

15698
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:26,820
know,

15699
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:27,030
good

15700
01:35:27,030 --> 01:35:27,210
at

15701
01:35:27,210 --> 01:35:27,390
it.

15702
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:28,140
And

15703
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:28,530
now,

15704
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:28,920
I

15705
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:29,160
never

15706
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:29,340
do

15707
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:29,490
it.

15708
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:30,240
But

15709
01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:30,420
it's

15710
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:30,690
what's

15711
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:30,780
the

15712
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:31,020
next

15713
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:31,470
challenge?

15714
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:31,560
You

15715
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:31,680
know,

15716
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,040
there's

15717
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,280
all

15718
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:32,340
the

15719
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:32,670
various

15720
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,240
experimental

15721
01:35:33,240 --> 01:35:33,720
techniques,

15722
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:33,810
the

15723
01:35:33,810 --> 01:35:34,410
dissections

15724
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:34,500
of

15725
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:34,590
the

15726
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:35,040
brain,

15727
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:35,430
you

15728
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:35,730
know,

15729
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,360
I

15730
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:36,630
can't

15731
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:36,780
tell

15732
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:36,870
you

15733
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:36,990
how

15734
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:37,410
many

15735
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:38,310
1000s

15736
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,400
of

15737
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:38,640
brain

15738
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:39,210
dissections

15739
01:35:39,210 --> 01:35:39,360
I've

15740
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:39,540
done

15741
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:39,750
in my

15742
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:40,020
life.

15743
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:40,110
And

15744
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:40,320
now I

15745
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:40,560
don't

15746
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:40,650
do

15747
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:40,770
them

15748
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:40,890
at

15749
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:41,100
all,

15750
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:41,280
it's

15751
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:41,460
and

15752
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:41,610
then

15753
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:41,700
you

15754
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:42,120
developed

15755
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:42,180
a

15756
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:42,510
method

15757
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:42,630
so

15758
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:42,720
that

15759
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:42,840
we

15760
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,020
don't

15761
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,200
have

15762
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:43,320
to

15763
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:43,530
does

15764
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:43,680
that

15765
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:43,980
grant,

15766
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:44,340
as

15767
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:44,430
you

15768
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:44,790
mentioned,

15769
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,910
that

15770
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:45,180
maybe

15771
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:45,330
tell

15772
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:45,450
us

15773
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:45,660
for a

15774
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:45,900
moment

15775
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:46,080
about

15776
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:46,770
clarity

15777
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:47,040
and

15778
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:47,190
for

15779
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:47,430
that,

15780
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,060
for

15781
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:48,660
people

15782
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,050
who

15783
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:49,590
will

15784
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:49,950
probably

15785
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:50,190
never

15786
01:35:50,190 --> 01:35:50,430
set

15787
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:50,640
foot

15788
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:50,820
into

15789
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:50,850
a

15790
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:51,570
laboratory.

15791
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:52,740
What

15792
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:52,890
an

15793
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:53,700
incredible,

15794
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:54,090
yet

15795
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:54,450
another

15796
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:55,020
incredible

15797
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:55,590
discovery,

15798
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:56,190
discovery

15799
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:56,280
and

15800
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:56,790
development

15801
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:57,540
clarity

15802
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:58,560
is,

15803
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,310
and

15804
01:35:59,310 --> 01:35:59,790
why

15805
01:35:59,790 --> 01:35:59,880
it

15806
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:00,270
helps

15807
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:00,420
us

15808
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:01,050
understand

15809
01:36:01,050 --> 01:36:01,170
how

15810
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:01,260
the

15811
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:01,530
brain

15812
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:01,620
is

15813
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,100
structured.

15814
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:02,730
So

15815
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:02,940
this

15816
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,420
is

15817
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:03,660
this

15818
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:03,840
is a

15819
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,200
different

15820
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:04,800
technology

15821
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:05,190
also

15822
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:05,640
developed

15823
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:06,180
in my

15824
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:06,450
lab

15825
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:06,870
here.

15826
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:07,140
And

15827
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:07,440
it's

15828
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:08,340
part

15829
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:08,490
of a

15830
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:09,120
broader

15831
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,020
approach

15832
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:10,140
that

15833
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:10,230
we

15834
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:10,500
call

15835
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,100
hydrogen

15836
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:11,580
tissue

15837
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:12,270
chemistry.

15838
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:12,420
And

15839
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:12,570
what

15840
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:12,780
this

15841
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:12,990
is,

15842
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:13,110
is

15843
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:13,290
it's

15844
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:13,890
building

15845
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,240
a gel

15846
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:15,480
like

15847
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:15,690
a

15848
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:16,290
clear

15849
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:16,710
jello

15850
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:17,190
like

15851
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:18,000
substance

15852
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:18,330
with

15853
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:18,720
from

15854
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,260
within

15855
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:19,560
all

15856
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:19,620
the

15857
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,250
cells

15858
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:20,700
of a

15859
01:36:20,730 --> 01:36:21,420
tissue,

15860
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:22,200
or

15861
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:22,410
even

15862
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:22,470
an

15863
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,950
animal

15864
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:23,520
all

15865
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:23,640
at

15866
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:23,940
once.

15867
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:24,120
So

15868
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:24,240
you're

15869
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:24,810
building,

15870
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:25,620
effectively

15871
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:25,950
building

15872
01:36:25,950 --> 01:36:26,430
a gel

15873
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:27,090
inside

15874
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:27,270
all

15875
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,360
the

15876
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:27,690
cells

15877
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:27,810
at

15878
01:36:27,810 --> 01:36:28,140
once.

15879
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,040
Now,

15880
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,280
that's

15881
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:29,670
a

do.

15885
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,200
Why

15886
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:31,380
do we

15887
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:31,560
do

15888
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:31,680
it?

15889
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:31,890
Well,

15890
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:32,190
we do

15891
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:33,060
it to

15892
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,080
transform

15893
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,430

01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:36,570

15901
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:40,230
And

15902
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:40,380
the

15908
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:42,240

01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,490
cellular

16085
01:37:44,490 --> 01:37:44,640
and

16086
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:44,850
sub

16087
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:45,210
cellular

16088
01:37:45,210 --> 01:37:45,600
level.

16089
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,080
And

16090
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:46,170
so

16091
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:46,350
this

16092
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:46,470
is

16093
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,890
hydrogen

16094
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:47,190
tissue

16095
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:47,640
chemistry,

16096
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:47,730
the

16097
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:48,090
first

16098
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:48,450
form

16099
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:48,810
we

16100
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,410
described

16101
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:49,560
was

16102
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:49,800
called

16103
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,370
clarity,

16104
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:51,000
we

16105
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:51,210
use

16106
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:51,540
that

16107
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:51,960
quite

16108
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,170
a bit

16109
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:52,470
still,

16110
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,590
but

16111
01:37:52,590 --> 01:37:52,770
there

16112
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:52,800
are

16113
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,430
many

16114
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,030
variants

16115
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:54,270
now

16116
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:54,390
that

16117
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,540
we

16118
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:54,660
and

16119
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:54,930
others

16120
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:55,080
have

16121
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,530
developed

16122
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:55,620
on

16123
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:55,800
this

16124
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,280
basic

16125
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:56,940
concept

16126
01:37:56,940 --> 01:37:57,000
of

16127
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:57,600
building

16128
01:37:57,840 --> 01:37:58,020
this

16129
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:58,410
gel

16130
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:58,590
than

16131
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:58,680
the

16132
01:37:58,680 --> 01:37:59,040
tissue

16133
01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,160
and

16134
01:37:59,160 --> 01:37:59,550
anchoring

16135
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,090
molecules

16136
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:00,270
into

16137
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:00,570
place,

16138
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:00,990
literally

16139
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:01,410
glass

16140
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:01,710
clear

16141
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:02,160
brains,

16142
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:02,310
I've

16143
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:02,520
done

16144
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:02,700
this,

16145
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:02,820
I've

16146
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:03,150
taken

16147
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:03,210
a

16148
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:03,510
brain

16149
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:03,990
cleared

16150
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:04,380
with

16151
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:04,590
this

16152
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,100
method,

16153
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:05,580
and

16154
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:05,940
looked

16155
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:06,060
at

16156
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:06,480
somebody

16157
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:06,750
through

16158
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:06,900
it,

16159
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,110
and

16160
01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:07,650
you

16161
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:07,770
don't

16162
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:07,890
want

16163
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:07,950
to

16164
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:08,040
get

16165
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:08,130
it

16166
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:08,250
too

16167
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:08,490
close

16168
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:08,550
to

16169
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:08,670
your

16170
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:08,820
eye,

16171
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:09,090
don't

16172
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:09,270
touch

16173
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:09,420
it to

16174
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:09,570
your

16175
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:09,720
own

16176
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:09,870
eye.

16177
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:10,530
But,

16178
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:11,130
and

16179
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:11,190
you

16180
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:11,340
can

16181
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:11,880
see

16182
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:12,390
direct

16183
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:12,630
all

16184
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:12,690
the

16185
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:12,840
way

16186
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:13,140
through

16187
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:13,320
it.

16188
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:16,740
That's

16189
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,340
incredible.

16190
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:17,850
For

16191
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,120
the,

16192
01:38:18,210 --> 01:38:18,510
it

16193
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:18,930
raises

16194
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:19,020
an

16195
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:19,320
important

16196
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:19,710
question,

16197
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:19,890
which

16198
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:20,010
is

16199
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,490
again,

16200
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:20,700
about

16201
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:20,760
the

16202
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,120
human

16203
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:21,540
brain.

16204
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:22,380
And

16205
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:22,500
as

16206
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:22,830
somebody

16207
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:22,980
who

16208
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:23,430
essentially

16209
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,700
started

16210
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:23,910
out

16211
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:24,000
in

16212
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:24,750
neuroanatomy,

16213
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:24,870
and

16214
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:24,990
then

16215
01:38:24,990 --> 01:38:25,170
got

16216
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:25,350
into

16217
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,530
other

16218
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,040
things,

16219
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,230
I, I

16220
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:28,860
always

16221
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:29,250
am

16222
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,810
bothered

16223
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:30,930
by

16224
01:38:30,930 --> 01:38:31,050
the

16225
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:31,320
fact

16226
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:31,470
that

16227
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:31,680
we

16228
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:32,010
actually

16229
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:32,250
know

16230
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:32,550
very

16231
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:32,880
little

16232
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:33,360
about

16233
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:33,600
the

16234
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,440
microstructure

16235
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:34,560
of

16236
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:34,650
the

16237
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:35,010
human

16238
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:35,430
brain,

16239
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:36,180
compared

16240
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:36,270
to

16241
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:36,330
the

16242
01:38:36,330 --> 01:38:36,690
brains

16243
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:36,810
of

16244
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,230
other

16245
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:38,160
organisms.

16246
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:39,000
And

16247
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:39,210
in

16248
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:39,540
thinking

16249
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:39,990
about

16250
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,680
understanding

16251
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:40,770
the

16252
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:41,430
circuitry

16253
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:41,700
and

16254
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:42,150
the

piano,

16256
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:42,900
so to

16257
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:43,260
speak

16258
01:38:43,260 --> 01:38:43,560
that

16259
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:43,770
and

16260
01:38:43,770 --> 01:38:43,890
how

16261
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:43,980
to

16262
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:44,610
manipulate

16263
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:45,000
it in

16264
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:45,240
order

16265
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:45,540
to

16266
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:46,950
relieve

16267
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:47,550
suffering.

16268
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:49,800
One

16269
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,460
wonders

16270
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:50,730
are

16271
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:50,880
the

16272
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,900
structures

16273
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,290
in

16274
01:38:52,290 --> 01:38:52,500
these

16275
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:52,830
animal

16276
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:53,430
brains?

16277
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:54,780
And

16278
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,020
how

16279
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:55,380
they

16280
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:55,980
behave

16281
01:38:55,980 --> 01:38:56,100
and

add,

16287
01:38:58,170 --> 01:38:58,710
etc.

16288
01:38:59,010 --> 01:38:59,370
Those

16289
01:38:59,370 --> 01:38:59,940
models

16290
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,270
how

16291
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:00,510
well

16292
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:00,660
they

16293
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:01,410
translate

16294
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:02,370
to

16295
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:02,490
the

16296
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:02,910
human

16297
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:03,480
condition.

16298
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,110
Do

16299
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:04,200
you

16300
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:04,410
think

16301
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:04,560
it's

16302
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:04,770
fair

16303
01:39:04,770 --> 01:39:04,860
to

16304
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:05,040
say

16305
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,220
that

16306
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:05,400
there

16307
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:05,580
are

16308
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:06,120
entire

16309
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:06,600
regions

16310
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:06,690
of

16311
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:06,750
the

16312
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:07,050
human

16313
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:07,590
brain

16314
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,310
that

16315
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,550
aren't

16316
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,820
just

16317
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,390
bigger,

16318
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:09,750
but

16319
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,900
that

16320
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:10,380
exists

16321
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:11,160
only

16322
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:11,520
in

16323
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:11,580
the

16324
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,000
brains

16325
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,120
of

16326
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:12,510
humans,

16327
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:12,960
especially

16328
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:13,200
given

16329
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:13,320
that

16330
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:13,440
we

16331
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:13,740
have

16332
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,310
this

16333
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:14,850
speech?

16334
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,090
Although

16335
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:15,420
I do

16336
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:15,780
wonder

16337
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:16,260
sometimes

16338
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:16,470
if

16339
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:16,650
you

16340
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:16,950
know,

16341
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:17,430
animals

16342
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:17,910
reporting

16343
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,030
to

16344
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:18,240
each

16345
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:18,570
other

16346
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:18,900
there,

16347
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:19,170
maybe

16348
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:19,320
they

16349
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:19,560
have

16350
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:19,770
little

16351
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:20,400
psychiatric

16352
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:20,790
sessions

16353
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,910
with

16354
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,090
one

16355
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:21,510
another?

16356
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:22,440
You

16357
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:22,590
know,

16358
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,310
I I'm

16359
01:39:23,310 --> 01:39:23,550
always

16360
01:39:23,550 --> 01:39:23,910
careful

16361
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:24,060
to

16362
01:39:24,060 --> 01:39:24,390
not

16363
01:39:25,230 --> 01:39:25,650
assume

16364
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:25,890
we do

16365
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:26,250
things

16366
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:26,790
better,

16367
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,120
we

16368
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:27,420
certainly

16369
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:28,170
understand

16370
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:28,890
what

16371
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:28,980
we're

16372
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:29,250
doing

16373
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:29,490
better

16374
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:29,610
than

16375
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:29,700
we

16376
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,150
understand

16377
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:30,270
what

16378
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:30,600
animals

16379
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:30,690
are

16380
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:31,020
doing.

16381
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:31,410
And

16382
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:31,560
they

16383
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:31,920
certainly

16384
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,040
do

16385
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,340
things

16386
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:32,610
better

16387
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:32,910
than

16388
01:39:32,940 --> 01:39:33,120
than

16389
01:39:33,120 --> 01:39:33,240
we

16390
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:33,480
do.

16391
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,200
That

16392
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:34,470
said,

16393
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,740
we do

16394
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:35,280
have

16395
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,060
amazing,

16396
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:36,420
wonderful

16397
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:36,840
brains

16398
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:36,960
and

16399
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,410
many

16400
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,040
structures

16401
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,190
that

16402
01:39:38,190 --> 01:39:38,310
are

16403
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,640
very

16404
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:38,940
highly

16405
01:39:38,940 --> 01:39:39,450
developed

16406
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:39,540
in

16407
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:39,660
our

16408
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:40,020
brains

16409
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:40,170
that

16410
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:41,010
are

16411
01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:41,370
not

16412
01:39:41,370 --> 01:39:41,700
nearly

16413
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:41,880
so

16414
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:42,330
developed

16415
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:42,420
in

16416
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:42,780
mice

16417
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,080
and,

16418
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:43,890
and

16419
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:44,190
fish,

16420
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:44,310
for

16421
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,790
example.

16422
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:45,870
Now,

16423
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:47,280
that

16424
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:47,550
said,

16425
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:47,640
when

16426
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:47,730
I

16427
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:47,970
look

16428
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:48,240
at

16429
01:39:48,270 --> 01:39:48,510
the

16430
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:48,750
big

16431
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:49,230
picture,

16432
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:49,350
you

16433
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:49,680
know,

16434
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:50,370
what,

16435
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,060
what

16436
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:51,180
is

16437
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:51,270
the

16438
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:51,750
mammalian

16439
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,080
brain

16440
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,320
really

16441
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:52,770
doing?

16442
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:54,870
There

16443
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,930
are

16444
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:55,350
things

16445
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:55,800
that

16446
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:56,160
you

16447
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:56,310
would

16448
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:56,640
never

16449
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:56,760
have

16450
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:57,030
thought

16451
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,150
we

16452
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:57,330
could

16453
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:57,930
study

16454
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:58,860
in in

16455
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,400
animals

16456
01:39:59,400 --> 01:39:59,730
and

16457
01:39:59,730 --> 01:39:59,970
language.

16458
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:00,480
Three

16459
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:00,960
mammals

16460
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,170
like

16461
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:01,770
mice,

16462
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:03,930
that

16463
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:03,990
it

16464
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,200
turns

16465
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:04,320
out,

16466
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:04,410
you

16467
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:04,740
can

16468
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:05,310
actually.

16469
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,270
And

16470
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:06,480
so I

16471
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:06,630
would

16472
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:06,930
never

16473
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:07,200
draw

16474
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,290
the

16475
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:07,590
line

16476
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,710
and

16477
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,130
say,

16478
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:08,400
here's

16479
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:08,880
something

16480
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:09,060
you

16481
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:09,330
can

16482
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:09,690
study

16483
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:09,780
in

16484
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:10,110
mice,

16485
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:10,200
or

16486
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:10,380
here's

16487
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:10,770
something

16488
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:11,040
that

16489
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:11,550

mice,

16494
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:12,840
I

16495
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:12,990
would

16496
01:40:12,990 --> 01:40:13,110
be

16497
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:13,470
very

16498
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:13,890
careful

16499
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:14,250

16505
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:16,710
that.

16506
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:17,250
A

16507

01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:18,090
is

16512
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:18,270
we've

16513
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:18,390
been

16514
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:18,600
able

16517
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:19,260
just

16518
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:19,320
in

01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:19,410

16523
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:20,370
to an

01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:21,090

16527
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:22,980
And

16528
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,550
both,

16529
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:23,790
we

16530
01:40:23,790 --> 01:40:23,970
had a

16532
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:24,690

16533
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:24,930
came

16534
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,080
out

16535
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,170

which

16545
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:29,100
we

16546
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:29,430
got

16547
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,060
to

01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,870

dissociation,

16556
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:34,110
what

16557
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:34,290
now

16558
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:34,470
what

16559
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,560
is

16560
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,370
dissociation

16561
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:35,520
that

16562
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:35,790
a lot

16563
01:40:35,790 --> 01:40:35,850
of

16564
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:36,360
people

16565
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:37,560
might

01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:37,770
not

16567
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:37,950

01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:38,790
it,

16570
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:38,940
but

16571
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:39,150
it's

16572
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:39,540
actually

16573
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:39,870
very

16574
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:40,410
common,

16575
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:40,800
more

16576
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,190
than

01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,120
70%

16586
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:45,930
it

16587
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:46,230
shows

16588
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:46,470
up in

01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:49,170
PTSD.

16594
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:49,920
What

16595
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,010
it

16596
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:50,280
is,

16597
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,520
is,

16598
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:50,670
is a

16599
01:40:50,670 --> 01:40:51,600
separation

16600
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:52,140
of

16601
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:52,560
the

16602
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:52,860
sense

16603
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:52,950
of

16604
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:53,490
self

16605
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,120
from

16606
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:54,420
the

16607
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:54,810
body,

16608
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:55,110
not

16609
01:40:55,110 --> 01:40:55,200
so

16610
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:55,290
you

16611
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:55,440
can

16612
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:55,560
have

16613
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:55,830
someone

16614
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:55,950
who

16615
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:56,190
it's

16616
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:56,460
not

16617
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:56,760
as if

16618
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:56,880
you're

16619
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:57,330
numb,

16620
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:57,480
you're

16621
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:57,690
not

16622
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:58,530
anesthetized,

16623
01:40:58,530 --> 01:40:58,620
you

16624
01:40:58,620 --> 01:40:58,770
can

16625
01:40:58,770 --> 01:40:59,220
still

16626
01:40:59,520 --> 01:40:59,670
you

16627
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:00,000
know,

16628
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,120
that

16629
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:00,510
something's

16630
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:00,840
happening

16631
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:00,930
to

16632
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,020
the

16633
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:01,410
body.

16634
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:02,130
But

16635
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:02,520
you

16636
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:02,760
just

16637
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:02,970
don't

16638
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:03,270
care,

16639
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,600
because

16640
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:03,660
you

16641
01:41:03,660 --> 01:41:03,900
don't

16642
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:04,350
ascribe

16643
01:41:04,350 --> 01:41:04,590
it to

16644
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:05,280
yourself.

16645
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:06,210
Which

16646
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:06,570
is

16647
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:07,110
very

16648
01:41:07,110 --> 01:41:07,590
interesting,

16649
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:07,770
right?

16650
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:07,980
That

16651
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:08,100
is,

16652
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:08,340
how

16653
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:08,790
interesting

16654
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,910
is

16655
01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:09,120
that

16656
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:09,960
report

16657
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:10,410
narrative?

16658
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:10,890
Yeah,

16659
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:11,550
almost,

16660
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:12,000
in

16661
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,120

and

16675
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:18,750
meaningful

16681
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:20,550
might

16682
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:20,700
be

self,

16693
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:25,470
and

16694
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:25,650
where

16695
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:25,740
it

16696
01:41:25,740 --> 01:41:25,890
might

16697
01:41:25,890 --> 01:41:26,400
reside?

16698
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,880
So in

16699
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:27,510
dissociative

16700
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,530
conditions,

16701
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,060
people

16702
01:41:30,090 --> 01:41:30,480
are

16703
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:31,020
feeling

16704
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:31,140
as

16705
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:31,290
kind

16706
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:31,620
of an

16707
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,100
absence

16708
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:32,310
of a

16709
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,760
merge

16710
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:33,120
between

16711
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:33,420
mind

16712
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:33,540
and

16713
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:33,990
body

16714
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:34,170
is

16715
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:34,320
that

16716
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:34,440
one

16717
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:34,560
way

16718
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:34,710
to

16719
01:41:34,710 --> 01:41:35,010
describe

16720
01:41:35,010 --> 01:41:35,100
it?

16721
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:35,550
And

16722
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:35,730
as I

16723
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:36,030
recall,

16724
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:36,180
this

16725
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:36,480
paper

16726
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,050
involved,

16727
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:37,650
an

16728
01:41:37,650 --> 01:41:38,220
exploration

16729
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:38,310
of

16730
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,880
ketamine.

16731
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,630
ketamine

16732
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:39,810
was a

16733
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:39,990
big

16734
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:40,200
part

16735
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:40,290
of

16736
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:40,380
it.

16737
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:40,560
Yeah,

16738
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:40,770
that's

16739
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:40,950
right.

16740
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:41,040
And

16741
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:41,160
so

16742
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:41,640
ketamine

16743
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,030
is

16744
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:42,330
another

16745
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:42,450
one

16746
01:41:42,450 --> 01:41:42,510
of

16747
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:42,660
those

16748
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:43,020
cases

16749
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:43,170
where

16750
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:43,440
people

16751
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:43,950
can

16752
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:44,550
experience

16753
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,510
dissociation,

16754
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:46,110
ketamine,

16755
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:46,200
or

16756
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:46,740
PCP,

16757
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:46,830
we

16758
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:47,070
call

16759
01:41:47,070 --> 01:41:47,310
these

16760
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:47,430
the

16761
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:48,300
dissociative

16762
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:48,900
drugs,

16763
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:49,020
they

16764
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:49,350
cause

16765
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:49,410
it

16766
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:49,650
just

16767
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:50,070
like

16768
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:50,760
these,

16769
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:50,970
these

16770
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:51,240
other

16771
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:51,930
psychiatric

16772
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:52,860
conditions

16773
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,010
can

16774
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:53,280
cause

16775
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,430
it.

16776
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:54,720
And

16777
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:55,230
so we

16778
01:41:55,230 --> 01:41:55,320
were,

16779
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:55,560
we

16780
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:55,680
were

16781
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:55,890
able

16782
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:56,430
to

16783
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:57,120
manifest

16784
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,660
this

16785
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,620
in in

16786
01:41:58,620 --> 01:41:59,100
mice,

16787
01:41:59,100 --> 01:41:59,280
were

16788
01:41:59,280 --> 01:41:59,970
administering

16789
01:41:59,970 --> 01:42:00,150
these

16790
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:00,840
dissociative

16791
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:01,560
agents

16792
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,860
in

16793
01:42:01,860 --> 01:42:02,100
mice,

16794
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:02,220
we

16795
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:02,400
could

16796
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:02,610
make

16797
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:02,790
them

16798
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:03,060
still

16799
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:03,300
able

16800
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:03,420
to

16801
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:03,990
detect

16802
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:04,590
stimulus

16803
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:04,740
but

16804
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:05,040
not

16805
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:05,340
care

16806
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:05,460
that

16807
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:05,550
it

16808
01:42:05,550 --> 01:42:05,970
was

16809
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:06,510
happening.

16810
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:07,350
All

16811
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,440
the

16812
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:07,770
while

16813
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:07,920
we

16814
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,460
were

16815
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:09,870
recording

16816
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:10,830
the

16817
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:11,400
activity

16818
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:11,490
of

16819
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,000
individual

16820
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,330
cells

16821
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:12,450
in

16822
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:12,510
the

16823
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:12,750
brain

16824
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:12,840
to

16825
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:13,050
see

16826
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:13,170
what

16827
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:13,290
was

16828
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:13,560
going

16829
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:13,770
on

16830
01:42:13,770 --> 01:42:14,040
what,

16831
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:14,550
what

16832
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,700
was

16833
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:15,120
happening

16834
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:15,510
along

16835
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:16,020
with

16836
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:16,650
this

16837
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:17,610
dissociation,

16838
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:18,240
and

16839
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:18,360
then

16840
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:18,540
use

16841
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:19,290
optogenetics,

16842
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:19,410
to

16843
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:19,650
see

16844
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:19,800
that

16845
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:19,890
it

16846
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:20,340
mattered

16847
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:20,670
to

16848
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:21,090
actually

16849
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:21,750
provide

16850
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:22,140
that

16851
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:22,860
pattern

16852
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:22,980
of

16853
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:23,400
activity

16854
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:23,490
and

16855
01:42:23,490 --> 01:42:23,670
see

16856
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,030
Oh,

16857
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:24,570
that

16858
01:42:24,570 --> 01:42:24,900
actually

16859
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:25,380
causes

16860
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:25,500
the

16861
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:26,220
dissociation.

16862
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,820
So we

16863
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:26,940
could

16864
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:27,060
do

16865
01:42:27,060 --> 01:42:27,240
all

16866
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:27,420
that

16867
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:27,510
in

16868
01:42:27,510 --> 01:42:28,050
mice,

16869
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:28,770
you

16870
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:28,860
know,

16871
01:42:28,860 --> 01:42:29,280
which,

16872
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:29,520
which

16873
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:29,850
was,

16874
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:29,970
you

16875
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:30,150
know,

16876
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,230
just

16877
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:32,100
who

16878
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:32,220
would

16879
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:32,280
have

16880
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:32,610
thought

16881
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:33,030
that

16882
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,150
you

16883
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:33,330
could

16884
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:33,570
study

16885
01:42:33,570 --> 01:42:33,840
something

16886
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:33,990
like

16887
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,140
this

16888
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,260
in

16889
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:34,560
mice.

16890
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:35,130
And

16891
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:35,220
we

16892
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:35,280
were

16893
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:35,490
able

16894
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:35,760

what

16914
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:43,140
we

01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:43,350

patients

16920
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:45,780
who

16921
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:46,020
come

16922
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:46,170
in,

16923
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:46,290
and

16924
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:46,380

normal

16929
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:47,550
clinical

16930
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:48,030
care,

16931
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:48,750
they

16932
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,110
have

16933
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:49,950
electrodes

16934
01:42:49,950 --> 01:42:50,460

16935
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:50,550
in

16936
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:50,670
their

16937
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:51,120
brain

16938
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:51,720
to

16939
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,200
identify

16940
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:52,410
where

16941
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:52,530
the

16942
01:42:52,530 --> 01:42:52,980
seizure

16943
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:53,430
is.

16944
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:53,610
So

16945
01:42:53,610 --> 01:42:53,730
they

16946
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:54,150
can

16947
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:54,630
be

16948
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:55,140
candidates

16949
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:55,380
for

16950
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,250
removing

16951
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:56,820
a

16952
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:57,030
little

16953
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,330
patch

16954
01:42:57,330 --> 01:42:57,390
of

16955
01:42:57,390 --> 01:42:57,450
the

16956
01:42:57,450 --> 01:42:57,750
brain

16957
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:57,900
that's

16958
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:58,290
causing

16959
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:58,380
the

16960
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:58,710
seizure,

16961
01:42:58,710 --> 01:42:58,860
this

16962
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:58,980
is

16963
01:42:58,980 --> 01:42:59,190
done

16964
01:42:59,190 --> 01:42:59,340
for

16965
01:42:59,340 --> 01:42:59,820
patients

16966
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,090
who

16967
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:00,810
medications

16968
01:43:00,810 --> 01:43:00,900
are

16969
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,140
not

16970
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:01,500
helping

16971
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:01,830
their

16972
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:02,220
seizure

16973
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:02,700
disorder.

16974
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:04,080
And

16975
01:43:04,110 --> 01:43:04,440
there

16976
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:05,040
was a

16977
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:05,580
patient

16978
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:05,670
who

16979
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,240
had a

16980
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:07,380
dissociative

16981
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:08,100
state

16982
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:08,640
before

16983
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:08,880
every

16984
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:09,360
seizure.

16985
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:09,510
So

16986
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:09,630
there

16987
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:09,780
was a

16988
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,050

16989
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:10,290

16991
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:10,500
was

16992
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:10,830
really

16993
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:11,490
dissociating,

16994
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:11,580
who

16995
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:11,730
could

16996
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:11,940
tell

16997
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:12,120
us

16998
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:12,450
literally

16999
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:12,660
as it

17000
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:12,780
was

17001
01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:13,290
happening.

17002
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:13,800
And

17003
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:13,920
we

17004
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,070
could

17005
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:14,580
see

17006
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:15,540
this

17007
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:15,990
pattern,

17008
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,080
the

01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:16,560
same

17011
01:43:16,950 --> 01:43:17,040
that

17012
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:17,160
was

17013
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:17,580
happening

17014
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:17,730

distances.

17052
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:29,940
And

17053
01:43:29,970 --> 01:43:30,090
we

17054
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:30,240
knew

17055
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:30,360
that

01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:30,420
it

17057
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:30,780
mattered

17058
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:31,050
to

01:43:31,050 --> 01:43:31,320
both

we

happen.

17073
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:34,980
So I

17074
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:35,220
just

17075
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:35,370

01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:38,010
that,

01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:38,490
I

01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:43,800
remove

17099
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:43,920
a

17100
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,670
particular

experience

17102
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:45,600
or

17103
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:45,990
behavior

17104
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,140
by

17105
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:46,740
lesioning,

17106
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:46,830
or

17107
01:43:46,830 --> 01:43:47,400
destroying,

17108
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:47,670
but

17109
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:48,210
then

17110
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:48,600
to go

17111
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:48,930
back

17112
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:49,200
and,

17113
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:49,860
and

17114
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:50,460
actually

17115
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:51,030
activate

17116
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:51,120
the

17117
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:51,360
same

17118
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:51,810
structure

17119
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:51,900
or

17120
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:52,110
group

17121
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:52,200
of

17122
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:52,740
structures

17123
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,040
and

17124
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:53,190
see

17125
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:53,310
the

17126
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:54,000
emergence.

17127
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:54,330
So

17128
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:54,600
it's

17129
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:55,470
essentially,

17130
01:43:55,650 --> 01:43:56,010
these

17131
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:56,220
days,

17132
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:56,310
you

17133
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,430
hear

17134
01:43:56,430 --> 01:43:56,640
a lot

17135
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:56,850
about

17136
01:43:56,850 --> 01:43:57,090

17140
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:58,050
in

17141
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:58,140
the

17142
01:43:58,140 --> 01:43:58,560

17143
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:58,650
of

17144
01:43:58,650 --> 01:43:58,980
viral

17145
01:43:58,980 --> 01:43:59,580
manipulation,

17146
01:43:59,580 --> 01:43:59,670
but

17147
01:43:59,670 --> 01:43:59,910
gain

17148
01:43:59,910 --> 01:43:59,970
of

17149
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:00,330
function

17150
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:00,420
is

17151
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:00,660
something

17152
01:44:00,660 --> 01:44:00,810
that

17153
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:01,170
we do

17154
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:01,260
in

17155
01:44:01,260 --> 01:44:01,320
the

17156
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:01,980
laboratory.

17157
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,490
And

17158
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:02,880
and

17159
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:03,300
you

17160
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:03,600
do in

17161
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,170
patients,

17162
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:04,980
to

17163
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:05,310
both

17164
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:05,640
take

17165
01:44:05,640 --> 01:44:05,850
away

17166
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:06,210
something

17167
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:06,330
and

17168
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:06,540
put

17169
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:06,660
it

17170
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,230
back.

17171
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:07,710
And

17172
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:08,040
which

17173
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:08,280
gives

17174
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:08,370
you

17175
01:44:08,370 --> 01:44:09,120
causality.

17176
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:09,300
That's

17177
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:09,570
right.

17178
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:10,200
And

17179
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:10,440
so

17180
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:10,620
and

17181
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:11,070
exactly

17182
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:11,190
and

17183
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:11,310
so

17184
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:11,400
with

17185
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:11,940
optogenetics,

01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:12,060
we

17187

17193
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:15,270

17199
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:17,280
or

17200
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:17,550
any,

17201
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:17,820
any

17203
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:18,210
and

17204
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:18,270
we

17205
01:44:18,270 --> 01:44:18,420
could

17206
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:18,750
cause

01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:18,840

17217
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:22,410
And

17218
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:22,560
that

17219
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:22,710
Who

17220
01:44:22,710 --> 01:44:22,830
would

17221
01:44:22,830 --> 01:44:22,890
have

17222
01:44:22,890 --> 01:44:23,130
thought

17223
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:23,220
you

17224
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:23,370
could

17225
01:44:23,370 --> 01:44:23,490
do

17226
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:23,700
that,

17227
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:23,910
but

there

17229
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:24,480

01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:26,820
Likewise,

likewise,

17237
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:27,390
we've

we

01:44:53,100 --> 01:44:53,280
and

17302
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:53,670
play

17303
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:54,120
in

17304
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:55,350
activity

17305
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,650
just

17306
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:55,740
to

17307
01:44:55,740 --> 01:44:56,010
those

17310
01:44:56,580 --> 01:44:56,820
these

17311
01:44:56,820 --> 01:44:57,210
animals

17312
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:57,270
are

17313
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,480

not

17317
01:44:58,290 --> 01:44:58,470
doing

17318
01:44:58,470 --> 01:44:58,770
anything

17319
01:44:58,770 --> 01:44:58,860
at

17320
01:44:58,860 --> 01:44:59,250
all,

17321
01:44:59,310 --> 01:44:59,490
and

17322
01:44:59,490 --> 01:44:59,610
we

17323
01:44:59,610 --> 01:44:59,940
could

17324
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,090
To

17325
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:00,960
activate

17326
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:01,260
just

17327
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:01,350
the

17328
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,770
vertical

17329
01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:02,070
bar

17330
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:02,490
cells,

17331
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:02,820
and

17332
01:45:02,850 --> 01:45:03,090
not

17333
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:03,240
only

17334
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:03,360
do

17335
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:03,480
the

17336
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:03,810
animal

17337
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:04,140
act

17338
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:04,470
as if

17339
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,560
it

17340
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:04,710
was

17341
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:05,010
seeing

17342
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:05,070
a

17343
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:05,430
vertical

17344
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,760
bar

17345
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:06,420
behaviorally,

17346
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:06,540
it

17347
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:06,660
was

17348
01:45:06,660 --> 01:45:06,960
trained

17349
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:07,170
to do

17350
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:07,560
particularly

17351
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:07,770
thing

17352
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:08,010
if it

17353
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:08,250
saw a

17354
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:08,550
vertical

17355
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:08,880
bar.

17356
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:09,000
And

17357
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:09,120
it

17358
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,330
did

17359
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:09,660
that

17360
01:45:09,690 --> 01:45:10,050
just

17361
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:10,440
as if

17362
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:10,950
it

17363
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:11,070
was

17364
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:11,340
seeing

17365
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:11,670
something

17366
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,090
visually.

17367
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:12,780
But

17368
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:13,140
everything

17369
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:13,230
in

17370
01:45:13,230 --> 01:45:13,290
the

17371
01:45:13,290 --> 01:45:13,680
brain

17372
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:13,770
that

17373
01:45:13,770 --> 01:45:13,890
we

17374
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:13,950
were

17375
01:45:13,950 --> 01:45:14,400
recording

17376
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:14,760
to

17377
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:14,910
the

17378
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:15,390
internal

17379
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:16,350
representation

17380
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:16,590
of

17381
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,100
this

17382
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:18,240
external

17383
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:18,570
world

17384
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:18,960
was

17385
01:45:18,990 --> 01:45:19,710
naturalistic,

17386
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:19,860
too,

17387
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:19,950
it

17388
01:45:19,950 --> 01:45:20,190
looked

17389
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:20,490
like

17390
01:45:20,490 --> 01:45:21,300
the

17391
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:21,870
brain

17392
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:22,110
was

17393
01:45:22,140 --> 01:45:22,500
seeing

17394
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:22,830
something

17395
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:23,130
visual.

17396
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:23,490
So

17397
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:23,790
that

17398
01:45:23,790 --> 01:45:23,880
was

17399
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:24,360
another

17400
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,900
that's

17401
01:45:24,930 --> 01:45:25,260
gain

17402
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:25,320
of

17403
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:25,710
function

17404
01:45:25,710 --> 01:45:25,950
to,

17405
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:26,070
you

17406
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:26,220
know,

17407
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:26,580
playing

17408
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:26,850
in

17409
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:27,630
providing

17410
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:28,470
a

17411
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:29,040
complex

17412
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:29,580
sensation

17413
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:29,700
or

17414
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:30,180
percept.

17415
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:30,270
That

17416
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:30,540
wasn't

17417
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:30,690
there

17418
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:31,140
before.

17419
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:31,680
And

17420
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:31,770
we

17421
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:31,920
can

17422
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,040
do

17423
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:32,250
that

17424
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:32,430
in,

17425
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:32,880
you

17426
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:33,150
know,

17427
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:33,720
across

17428
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,140
species.

17429
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:35,010
So I

17430
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:35,220
we

17431
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:35,580
haven't,

17432
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:36,240
you

17433
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:36,540
know,

17434
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:36,840
and

17435
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:36,900
of

17436
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,170
course,

17437
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:37,470
mice

17438
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:37,590
are

17439
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:38,100
social,

17440
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:38,580
and

17441
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:38,670
they

17442
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:39,120
do,

17443
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:39,570
they

17444
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:39,720
do

17445
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,140
amazing

17446
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:40,470
acts

17447
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,620
of

17448
01:45:40,620 --> 01:45:41,190
information

17449
01:45:41,190 --> 01:45:41,820
processing.

17450
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:42,180
And

17451
01:45:42,180 --> 01:45:42,330
so

17452
01:45:42,330 --> 01:45:42,750
I'm I

17453
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:43,140
don't,

17454
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,220
I try

17455
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:44,430
not

17456
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:44,490
to

17457
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:45,060
disparage

17458
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:45,480
our

17459
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:46,020
cousins

17460
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:46,320
too

17461
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:46,680
much.

17462
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:46,890
We

17463
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:47,280
certainly

17464
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:47,340
have

17465
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:47,640
helped

17466
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:47,700
the

17467
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:47,970
field

17468
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:48,060
of

17469
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:48,600
neuroscience

17470
01:45:48,630 --> 01:45:48,900
and

17471
01:45:48,900 --> 01:45:49,350
medicine,

17472
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:49,470
I

17473
01:45:49,470 --> 01:45:49,650
should

17474
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:50,070
mention,

17475
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:50,250
and I

17476
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:50,400
know

17477
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:50,580
that

17478
01:45:50,580 --> 01:45:50,850
people

17479
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:50,910
are

17480
01:45:50,910 --> 01:45:51,150
very

17481
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:51,870
sensitivities

17482
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:52,110
about

17483
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:52,380
animal

17484
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:52,740
research,

17485
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:53,040
but

17486
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:53,580
the

17487
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:53,790
work

17488
01:45:53,790 --> 01:45:54,090
that's

17489
01:45:54,090 --> 01:45:54,570
been

17490
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,020
carried

17491
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:55,170
out

17492
01:45:55,170 --> 01:45:55,260
in

17493
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:55,530
mice

17494
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:55,650
has

17495
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:55,890
been

17496
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:56,880
absolutely

17497
01:45:57,930 --> 01:45:58,650
vital,

17498
01:45:58,980 --> 01:45:59,310
and

17499
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:00,000
instructional

17500
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:00,750

17501
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:01,530
treatment

17502
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:01,650

17505
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:04,350
Since

17506
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:04,500
we

17507
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:04,740
talked

17508
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:05,070
about

17509
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:06,270
dissociation,

17510
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:07,170

17511
01:46:07,170 --> 01:46:07,980
dissociative

17513
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:09,540
rather,

17514
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:09,930

ketamine,

17516
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:10,710
I'd

17517
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:10,920
love

17518
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,070

17523
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:15,030
You

17524
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:15,240
know,

17525
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:15,600

17530
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:18,030
having

17531
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:18,360

17532
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:18,570

it

17540
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,160

17541
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:20,370

17571
01:46:31,950 --> 01:46:32,220

01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:34,470

01:46:35,820 --> 01:46:36,480
essentially,

17581
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:37,080
putting

01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:40,050
obviously

17589
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:40,320
using

17590
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:40,410
them

17591
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:41,130
recreationally,

17592
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:41,250
but

17593
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:41,520
putting

01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:41,670

but

01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:45,660
also

01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:47,370
tremendous

01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:48,150

01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:48,510

psychiatric

17609
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:50,580
illness.

17610
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:50,760
In

17611
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:50,910
other

17612
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:51,120

17613
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:51,390
many

17614
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:51,660
people

17615
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:51,990
lost

17616
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:52,140
their

17617
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:52,440
minds

17618
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:52,620
as a

17619
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,220
consequence

17620
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:53,460
of

17621
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,090
overuse

17622
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:54,180

01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:54,750
psychedelics,

17624
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:54,870
I'll

17625
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:55,110
probably

17626
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:55,350
lose

17627
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,950
a few

17628
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,000

17629
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,210
out

17630
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:57,660
there.

17631
01:46:59,100 --> 01:46:59,850
But I

17632
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:00,060
do

17633
01:47:00,060 --> 01:47:00,240
want

17634
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:00,480
to

17635
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:00,930

17636
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,500
about

17637
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:02,550
what

17638
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:02,670
is

17639
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:02,760
the

17641
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:03,300
of

17642
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:03,540

17644
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:04,620
and I

17645
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:04,980
realized

17646
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:05,100
it's

17647
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:05,130
a

17648
01:47:05,130 --> 01:47:05,490

17652
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:06,690
But

01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:25,920
going

17708
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:26,160
to be

17709
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:26,460
for

17710
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,090
treating

17711
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:27,690
depression,

17712
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:27,810
and

17713
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:27,990
then

17714
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:28,470
if we

17715
01:47:28,470 --> 01:47:28,770
have

17716
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:28,890
the

17717
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:29,130
time,

17718
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:29,250
we

17719
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:29,430
could

17720
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:29,700
talk

17721
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:29,910
about

17722
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:30,330
trauma

17723
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:30,450
and

17724
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:31,050
MDMA

17725
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:31,140
and

17726
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:31,320
some

17727
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:31,410
of

17728
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:31,590
that?

17729
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:32,790
Well,

17730
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:33,060
you're

17731
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:33,420
you're

17732
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:33,750
right

17733
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,140
to

17734
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:34,650
highlight

17735
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:34,980
both

17736
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,180
opportunity

17737
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:36,690
and,

17738
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:37,080
and

17739
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:37,320
the

17740
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:37,830
parallel

17741
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:38,070
that

17742
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,220
is

17743
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:38,640
there.

17744
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,320
And,

17745
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:40,560
of

17746
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:40,830
course,

17747
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:40,920
we

17748
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,070
want

17749
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:41,130
to

17750
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:41,340
help

17751
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:41,790
patients

17752
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:41,910
and

17753
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:42,000
of

17754
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,300
course,

17755
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:42,420
we

17756
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:42,810
want

17757
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,260
to,

17758
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,070
to

17759
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:44,910
explore

17760
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:45,300
anything

17761
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:45,510
that

17762
01:47:45,570 --> 01:47:46,110
might

17763
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:46,860
be

17764
01:47:46,860 --> 01:47:47,250
helpful

17765
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:47,370
and

17766
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:47,490
but

17767
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:47,580
we

17768
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:47,730
want

17769
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:47,910
to do

17770
01:47:47,910 --> 01:47:48,090
it in

17771
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:48,180
a

17772
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:48,540
safe

17773
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:48,840
and

17774
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:49,260
rigorous

17775
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:49,560
way.

17776
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,270
But I

17777
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:51,540
do

17778
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:51,840
think

17779
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:51,960
we

17780
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:52,140
should

17781
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:52,590
explore

17782
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:52,950
these

17783
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:53,160
these

17784
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:53,580
avenues.

17785
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:53,790
These

17786
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:54,210
are

17787
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:55,680
agents

17788
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:55,830
that

17789
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,490
alter

17790
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,150
reality

17791
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:57,270
and

17792
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:57,570
alter

17793
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:57,690
the

17794
01:47:57,690 --> 01:47:58,230
experience

17795
01:47:58,230 --> 01:47:58,440
of

17796
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:58,980
reality,

17797
01:47:58,980 --> 01:47:59,070
I

17798
01:47:59,070 --> 01:47:59,250
should

17799
01:47:59,250 --> 01:47:59,640
say,

17800
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:00,960
in in

17801
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:01,560
relatively

17802
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:02,040
precise

17803
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:02,430
ways,

17804
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:02,850
they

17805
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:03,270
they

17806
01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:03,420
do

17807
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:03,600
have

17808
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,110
problems,

17809
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:04,230
they

17810
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:04,440
can

17811
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:04,560
be

17812
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,130
addictive,

17813
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:05,310
they

17814
01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:05,460
can

17815
01:48:05,460 --> 01:48:05,910
cause

17816
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:06,570
lasting

17817
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,200
change,

17818
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:07,350
that

17819
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:07,470
is

17820
01:48:07,470 --> 01:48:07,770
not

17821
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,460
desirable.

17822
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:10,500
But

17823
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:10,650
we

17824
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:10,830
have

17825
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:11,070
to

17826
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:11,340
see

17827
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:11,580
these

17828
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:11,700
as

17829
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:12,360
opportunities,

17830
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:12,510
we

17831
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:12,660
have

17832
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,560
to

17833
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:13,950
first

17834
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:14,040
of

17835
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:14,400
all

17836
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:14,820
study

17837
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:14,880
in

17838
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:14,940
the

17839
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,540
laboratory,

17840
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:15,660
and

17841
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:15,780
I'm

17842
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:16,080
doing

17843
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:16,590
this

17844
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:17,460
here,

17845
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:17,670
you

17846
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:17,880
know,

17847
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:18,120
we

17848
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:18,450
have

17849
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:19,560
big,

17850
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:20,430
we

17851
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:20,580
have

17852
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,000
safes

17853
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:21,150
with

17854
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:21,630
many

17855
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:22,290
interesting

17856
01:48:22,290 --> 01:48:23,010
psychedelics

17857
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:23,190
that

17858
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:23,220
are

17859
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:23,520
all

17860
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:23,760
very

17861
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:24,210
carefully

17862
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:24,810
regulated,

17863
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:24,900
we

17864
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,110
get

17865
01:48:25,110 --> 01:48:25,740
inspections

17866
01:48:25,740 --> 01:48:25,920
from

17867
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:26,100
the

17868
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:26,760
DEA,

17869
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:26,880
and

17870
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,090
so

17871
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:27,210
on.

17872
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:27,510
anyone's

17873
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:27,750
hoping

17874
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:27,810
to

17875
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:28,080
find

17876
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,260
these

17877
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:28,530
labs,

17878
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:28,650
they

17879
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:28,980
exist

17880
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:29,070
in

17881
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:29,340
outer

17882
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:29,850
space

17883
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,150
you

17884
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:30,390
need,

17885
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:30,780
you

17886
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:30,960
need

17887
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:31,230
to be

17888
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:31,410
on

17889
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:31,680
board,

17890
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:31,830
one

17891
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:31,920
of

17892
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,100
the

17893
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:32,610
one

17894
01:48:32,610 --> 01:48:32,730
of

17895
01:48:32,730 --> 01:48:32,790
the

17896
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:33,480
SpaceX

17897
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:34,230
missions

17898
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:34,320
in

17899
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:34,530
order

17900
01:48:34,530 --> 01:48:34,590
to

17901
01:48:34,590 --> 01:48:34,950
access

17902
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:35,070
them.

17903
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:35,160
So

17904
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:35,370
don't

17905
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:35,580
try

17906
01:48:35,580 --> 01:48:35,670
and

17907
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:36,090
confine

17908
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:36,300
now

17909
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:36,540
that's

17910
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:36,960
exactly

17911
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:37,170
true.

17912
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:37,500
Yes.

17913
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:39,030
And,

17914
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:39,510
and,

17915
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:40,890
and

17916
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:41,160
we're

17917
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:41,550
doing

17918
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:41,910
exactly

17919
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:42,060
this,

17920
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,450
we're

17921
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:42,690
saying

17922
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:42,870
this

17923
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:43,080
is an

17924
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,440
incredible

17925
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:43,770
opportunity,

17926
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:43,920
if we

17927
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,040
could

17928
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,850
understand

17929
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:45,840
how,

17930
01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:46,590
you

17931
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:46,860
know,

17932
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:47,370
the

17933
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:47,880
perception

17934
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:47,940
of

17935
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:48,330
reality

17936
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:48,450
is

17937
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,020
altered,

17938
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:49,290
we

17939
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:49,500
could

17940
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:49,770
be

17941
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:50,250
creating

17942
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:50,970
new

17943
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:51,450
kinds

17944
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:51,510
of

17945
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:52,050
intervention

17946
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:52,170
that

17947
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:52,440
don't

17948
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:52,890
have

17949
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:53,910
the

17950
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,630
risks

17951
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,770
and

17952
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:56,580
problems

17953
01:48:56,580 --> 01:48:57,270
of

17954
01:48:57,300 --> 01:48:57,690
causing

17955
01:48:57,690 --> 01:48:58,080
lasting

17956
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:58,590
change

17957
01:48:58,590 --> 01:48:59,040
or

17958
01:48:59,040 --> 01:48:59,490
addiction.

17959
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:00,600
Now,

17960
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,680
that

17961
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:02,100
said,

17962
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,240
even

17963
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:03,900
as

17964
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,080
these

17965
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:04,710
medications

17966
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,310
exist

17967
01:49:05,310 --> 01:49:05,910
now,

17968
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:06,360
as

17969
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:06,450
you

17970
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:06,720
know,

17971
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,200
there's

17972
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,010
an

17973
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:08,400
impulse

17974
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:08,610
to

17975
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:09,000
use

17976
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:09,240
them

17977
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:09,390
in

17978
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:09,630
very

17979
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:09,960
small

17980
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:10,440
doses

17981
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:10,560
and

17982
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:10,620
to

17983
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:10,800
use

17984
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:10,980
them

17985
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,130
as

17986
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:12,060
adjunctive

17987
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:12,720
treatments

17988
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,140
for

17989
01:49:13,170 --> 01:49:13,530
for

17990
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:13,710
the

17991
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,130
therapy

17992
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:14,280
of

17993
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:14,790
various

17994
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:15,120
kinds.

17995
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:15,240
And

17996
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:15,600
I'm

17997
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:15,930
also

17998
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:16,440
supportive

17999
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:16,530
of

18000
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:16,800
that,

18001
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:16,950
if

18002
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:17,340
done,

18003
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:17,730
you

18004
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:17,850
know,

18005
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:18,390
carefully

18006
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:18,660
and

18007
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:19,320
rigorously.

18008
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:20,070
Of

18009
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,340
course,

18010
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:20,520
there's

18011
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:20,820
risk,

18012
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:21,000
but

18013
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:21,270
there's

18014
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,600
risk

18015
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:21,960
with

18016
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:22,620
many

18017
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:22,770
other

18018
01:49:22,770 --> 01:49:23,130
kinds

18019
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:23,460
of

18020
01:49:23,460 --> 01:49:23,910
treatments.

18021
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:24,030
And

18022
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:24,150
I'm

18023
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:24,360
not

18024
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:24,720
sure

18025
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:24,900
that

18026
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:25,020
the

18027
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:25,530
risks

18028
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,280
for

18029
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:27,210
these

18030
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:28,320
medications

18031
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:29,610
vastly

18032
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:29,940
outweigh

18033
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:30,090
the

18034
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:30,420
risks

18035
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:30,540
that

18036
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:30,660
we

18037
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:30,990
normally

18038
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:31,410
tolerate

18039
01:49:31,410 --> 01:49:31,500
in

18040
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:31,680
other

18041
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:32,100
branches

18042
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:32,160
of

18043
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:32,580
medicine.

18044
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:33,150
Why

18045
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:33,360
would

18046
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:33,510
they

18047
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:34,020
work?

18048
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:34,500
I

18049
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:34,710
mean,

18050
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:35,070
the,

18051
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:36,510
you

18052
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:36,690
know,

18053
01:49:37,170 --> 01:49:37,860
let's

18054
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:38,370
say

18055
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:39,390
that,

18056
01:49:39,390 --> 01:49:39,900
indeed,

18057
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:40,050
their

18058
01:49:40,050 --> 01:49:40,470
main

18059
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:41,010
effect

18060
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:41,400
is to

18061
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:41,970
create

18062
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:42,720
more,

18063
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:43,920
more

18064
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,730
conductivity,

18065
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:44,820
at

18066
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:45,150
least

18067
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:45,690
in

18068
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:45,900
the

18069
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:46,320
in

18070
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:46,380
the

18071
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:46,860
moment

18072
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:47,820
between

18073
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:48,030
brain

18074
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:48,240
areas.

18075
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:48,540
So

18076
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,020
the

18077
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:49,290
way I

18078
01:49:49,290 --> 01:49:49,500
think

18079
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:49,710
about

18080
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:49,740
a

18081
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:50,130
very

18082
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,060
think

18083
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:51,240
about

18084
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:51,330
the

18085
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:51,690
two

18086
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:52,260
extremes

18087
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:52,920
of my

18088
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:53,400
experience

18089
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:53,850
anyways,

18090
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:54,180
a

18091
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:54,570
high

18092
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:55,020
degree

18093
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:55,140
of

18094
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:55,590
stress

18095
01:49:55,590 --> 01:49:55,710
and

18096
01:49:55,710 --> 01:49:56,220
focus

18097
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:56,400
for

18098
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:56,700
whatever

18099
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:57,090
reason,

18100
01:49:57,330 --> 01:49:57,510
is

18101
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:57,690
going

18102
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:57,780
to

18103
01:49:57,780 --> 01:49:58,080
make

18104
01:49:58,200 --> 01:49:58,560
create

18105
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:58,890
changes

18106
01:49:58,890 --> 01:49:59,100
in my

18107
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,460
visual

18108
01:49:59,460 --> 01:49:59,790
field

18109
01:49:59,790 --> 01:49:59,970
and

18110
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:00,960
changes

18111
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,050
in

18112
01:50:01,050 --> 01:50:01,110
the

01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:01,230
way

18114
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:01,380
that

18115
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:01,440
I

18116
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:01,860
perceive

18117
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:02,250
times

18118
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:02,400
that

18119
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:02,460
I'm

18120
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:02,580
going

18121
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:02,640
to

18122
01:50:02,640 --> 01:50:02,940

I

18126
01:50:04,020 --> 01:50:04,440
might

18127
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:04,680
mean

18128
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:04,710
a

18129
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:04,920
very

18130
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:05,490
contracted

18132
01:50:05,730 --> 01:50:05,880
of

01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,240
whatever

experiences,

18136
01:50:07,290 --> 01:50:07,560
whereas

18137
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:07,650
on

18138
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:07,770
the

01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:08,790
extreme,

18141
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:09,870
in a,

18142
01:50:09,930 --> 01:50:10,140

dream,

18144
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:11,280
or in

01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:11,580

are

18150
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:12,510
very

18151
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:13,050
fluid,

18152
01:50:13,410 --> 01:50:14,070
and

18153
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:14,670
essentially

18154
01:50:14,670 --> 01:50:15,180
relaxed.

18155
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:15,420
Although

18156
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:15,510
it

18157
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,750
might

18158
01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:15,960
be a

18159
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:16,290
very

18160
01:50:16,290 --> 01:50:16,740
interesting

01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:19,650
seem

18168
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:19,980
to be

18169
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:20,220
a

18171
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:22,320
not

18174
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,310

01:50:23,310 --> 01:50:23,550
off

18176
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:23,790
from

18177
01:50:23,790 --> 01:50:23,880
the

18179
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:24,660

01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:27,990
essentially

18186
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:28,380
not

18187
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:28,560
as

18188
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,130
rigid.

18189
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:30,420
And

18190
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:30,750
there

18191
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:30,870
is

18192
01:50:30,870 --> 01:50:31,050
this

01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:31,380
element

18194
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:31,500
of

synesthesia,

18196
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:32,220
a

18197
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:32,700
blending

18198
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:32,820
of

01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:32,880
the

01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,600
senses,

18201
01:50:34,110 --> 01:50:34,290
you

18202
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:34,620
know,

18203
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:35,220
feeling

18204
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:35,790
colors,

18205
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:36,180
and

18206
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:37,950
hearing

18207
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:39,060
light

18208
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:39,180
and

18209
01:50:39,180 --> 01:50:39,450
things

18210
01:50:39,450 --> 01:50:39,510
of

01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,690
that

18212
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,110
sort.

18213
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:40,410
If

18214
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:40,890
you

18215
01:50:40,890 --> 01:50:41,070
hear

18216
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:41,280
these

18217
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:41,820
reports

18218
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:42,270
anyway.

18219
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:43,920
Why

18220
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:44,100
would

18221
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:44,580
having

18222
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:44,850
that

18223
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:45,510
dreamlike

18224
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,470
experience

18225
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:48,630
somehow

18226
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:49,110
relieve

18227
01:50:49,110 --> 01:50:49,650
depression?

18228
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:50,430
Long

18229
01:50:50,430 --> 01:50:50,760
term?

18230
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:51,810
Do we

18231
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:51,960
have

18232
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:52,260
any

18233
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:52,620
idea

18234
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:53,040
why

18235
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,250
that

18236
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:53,550
might

18237
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:53,880
be?

18238
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:56,250
We

18239
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:56,400
have

18240
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:56,610
some

18241
01:50:56,610 --> 01:50:57,090
ideas?

18242
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:57,210
Uh,

18243
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:57,750
no,

18244
01:50:57,780 --> 01:50:58,140
no

18245
01:50:58,140 --> 01:50:58,470
deep

18246
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:59,190
understanding.

18247
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:00,120
One

18248
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:00,870
way I

18249
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:01,110
think

18250
01:51:01,110 --> 01:51:01,350
about

18251
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,410
the

18252
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:02,100
psychedelics

18253
01:51:02,100 --> 01:51:02,340
is

18254
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:02,820
they

18255
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:05,520
increase

18256
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:05,880
our

18257
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:06,420
willingness

18258
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:06,750
to

18259
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:07,830
increase

18260
01:51:07,830 --> 01:51:07,920
the

18261
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:08,280
willingness

18262
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:08,400
of

18263
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:08,490
our

18264
01:51:08,490 --> 01:51:08,880
brain

18265
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,000
to

18266
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:09,600
accept

18267
01:51:09,630 --> 01:51:10,680
unlikely

18268
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:12,090
ways

18269
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:12,210
of

18270
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:12,900
constructing

18271
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:13,020
the

01:51:13,020 --> 01:51:13,320
world

18273
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:13,830
unlikely

18274
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:14,580
hypotheses

18275
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:14,850
as it

18276
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:15,060
were,

18277
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:15,300
as to

18278
01:51:15,300 --> 01:51:15,510
what's

18279
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:15,750
going

18280
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:15,990
on

18281
01:51:16,410 --> 01:51:16,560
the

18283
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:17,280

cortex,

18286
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:18,360
I

18287
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:18,660
think

18288
01:51:18,660 --> 01:51:19,170
is a

18289
01:51:19,530 --> 01:51:20,280

testing

18293
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:21,840
machine,

18294
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:21,990
it's

18295
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,230
coming

18296
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:22,350
up

18297
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:22,470
with

18298
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,890
models

18299
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:23,130
about

18300
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:23,640
everything,

18301
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:24,030
it's

18302
01:51:24,030 --> 01:51:24,420
got

18303
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:25,350
all

18304
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:25,410
the

18305
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:25,680

18309
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,730
in.

18310
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:27,090
And

18311
01:51:27,090 --> 01:51:27,450
it's

18312
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:27,930
making

18313
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:28,440

01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:28,950
updating

18316
01:51:28,950 --> 01:51:29,040
the

18317
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:29,430
models

18318
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:29,520
and

18319
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:29,910
changing

18320
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:30,240
them

18321
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:30,840
theories

18322
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:31,620
hypotheses

18323
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:31,770
for

18324
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:31,980
what's

18325
01:51:31,980 --> 01:51:32,220
going

18326
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:32,490
on.

18327
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:33,990
And

18328
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:34,200
some

18329
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:34,290
of

18330
01:51:34,290 --> 01:51:34,440
those

18331
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:34,710
never

18332
01:51:34,710 --> 01:51:35,010
reach

18333
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:35,280
our

18334
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:35,760
conscious

18335
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:36,030
mind.

18336
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:36,120
And

18337
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:36,210
this

18338
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:36,270
is

18339
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:36,570
something

18340
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:36,660
I

18341
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:36,930
talked

18342
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:37,200
about

18343
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:37,410
in

18344
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,100
projections,

18345
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,310
and

18346
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:38,490
in

18347
01:51:38,490 --> 01:51:38,580
the

18348
01:51:38,580 --> 01:51:38,940
book,

18349
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:39,750
quite

18350
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:40,020
a bit

18351
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:40,350
is,

18352
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:41,460
many

18353
01:51:41,460 --> 01:51:41,520
of

18354
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:41,670
these

18355
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:41,760
are

18356
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:42,120
filtered

18357
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:42,300
out

18358
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:42,600
before

18359
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:42,720
they

18360
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:42,930
get

18361
01:51:42,930 --> 01:51:43,050
to

18362
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:43,440
our

18363
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,070
conscious

18364
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,520
mind.

18365
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:44,700
And

18366
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:44,880
that's

18367
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,150
good.

18368
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:46,140
We

18369
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:46,470
think

18370
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:46,590
how

18371
01:51:46,590 --> 01:51:47,130
distracted

18372
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:47,280
we'd

18373
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:47,580
be if

18374
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:47,700
we

18375
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:47,820
were

18376
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:48,390
constantly

18377
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:48,690
having

18378
01:51:48,690 --> 01:51:48,810
to

18379
01:51:48,810 --> 01:51:49,380
evaluate

18380
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:49,530
all

18381
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:49,860
these,

18382
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:50,010
you

18383
01:51:50,010 --> 01:51:50,160
know,

18384
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:50,880
hypotheses

18385
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,210
about

18386
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:51,750
what

18387
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:51,990
kinds

18388
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:52,080
of

18389
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:52,440
shapes

18390
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:52,530
or

18391
01:51:52,530 --> 01:51:52,950
objects

18392
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:53,040
or

18393
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:53,580
processes

18394
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:53,700
were

18395
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:53,850
out

18396
01:51:53,850 --> 01:51:54,030
there.

18397
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:54,960
And

18398
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:55,110
so a

18399
01:51:55,110 --> 01:51:55,290
lot

18400
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:55,380
of

18401
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:55,530
this

18402
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:55,860
is

18403
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:56,370
handled,

18404
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:57,960
before

18405
01:51:57,960 --> 01:51:58,020
it

18406
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:58,290
gets

18407
01:51:58,290 --> 01:51:58,410
to

18408
01:51:58,410 --> 01:51:59,010
consciousness,

18409
01:51:59,040 --> 01:51:59,250
what

18410
01:51:59,250 --> 01:51:59,310
the

18411
01:51:59,310 --> 01:51:59,880
psychedelics

18412
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,120
seem

18413
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:00,690
to do

18414
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,080
is

18415
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:01,530
they

18416
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,030
change

18417
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:03,450
the

18418
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,740
threshold

18419
01:52:04,770 --> 01:52:05,070
for

18420
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:05,490
us to

18421
01:52:05,490 --> 01:52:05,910
become

18422
01:52:05,910 --> 01:52:06,390
aware

18423
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:06,480
of

18424
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:06,930
these

18425
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:07,560
incomplete

18426
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,370
hypotheses

18427
01:52:08,370 --> 01:52:08,490
or

18428
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:08,760
wrong

18429
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:09,540
hypotheses

18430
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:09,930
or,

18431
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:10,800
or

18432
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:11,460
concepts

18433
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:11,580
that

18434
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:11,790
might

18435
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:11,910
be

18436
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:12,660
noise,

18437
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:13,350
but

18438
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,440
are

18439
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:13,680
just

18440
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:14,160
wrong,

18441
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:14,310
and

18442
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:14,460
so

18443
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:14,550
are

18444
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:14,880
never

18445
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,270
allowed

18446
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:15,390
to

18447
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:15,600
get

18448
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:15,900
into

18449
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:16,230
our

18450
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:16,620
conscious

18451
01:52:16,620 --> 01:52:16,950
mind.

18452
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:18,390
Now,

18453
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:19,110
you

18454
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:19,200
know

18455
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,650
that

18456
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:20,130
that's

18457
01:52:20,250 --> 01:52:20,550
pretty

18458
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,940
interesting.

18459
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:21,060
And

18460
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:21,180
it

18461
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:21,420
goes

18462
01:52:21,420 --> 01:52:21,780
wrong

18463
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:21,990
and

18464
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:22,740
psychiatric

18465
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:23,280
disorders,

18466
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:23,370
I

18467
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:23,730
think,

18468
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:24,660
in

18469
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,590
schizophrenia,

18470
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:25,710
at

18471
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:26,010
some

18472
01:52:26,040 --> 01:52:26,400
times,

18473
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:26,520
the

18474
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:27,330
paranoid

18475
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:28,590
delusions

18476
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:28,680
that

18477
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:28,980
people

18478
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:29,370
have

18479
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:29,610
are

18480
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:30,180
examples

18481
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:30,420
of

18482
01:52:31,170 --> 01:52:31,620
these

18483
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:32,850
poor

18484
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:33,300
models

18485
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:33,510
that

18486
01:52:33,510 --> 01:52:33,960
escape

18487
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:34,200
into

18488
01:52:34,200 --> 01:52:34,320
the

18489
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:34,770
conscious

18490
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:35,130
mind

18491
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:35,250
and

18492
01:52:35,250 --> 01:52:35,910
become

18493
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:36,840
accepted

18494
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:36,960
as

18495
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,410
reality,

18496
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:37,500
and

18497
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:37,620
they

18498
01:52:37,620 --> 01:52:37,980
never

18499
01:52:38,010 --> 01:52:38,310
should

18500
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,400
have

18501
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,670
gotten

18502
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:38,880
out

18503
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:39,180
there.

18504
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:40,500
Now,

18505
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:40,650
how

18506
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:40,860
could

18507
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:41,220
something

18508
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:41,430
like

18509
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:41,760
this

18510
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:41,910
in

18511
01:52:41,910 --> 01:52:42,000
the

18512
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:42,270
right

18513
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:42,750
way,

18514
01:52:43,140 --> 01:52:43,440
help

18515
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:43,560
with

18516
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:43,860
something

18517
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:44,100
like

18518

depression,

18519
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:45,780
patients

18520
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:45,930
with

01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:46,440
depression

18522
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:46,920
often

18523
01:52:46,950 --> 01:52:47,700
are,

18524
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:49,440
are

18525
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:49,920
stuck,

18526
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:50,820
they

18527
01:52:50,850 --> 01:52:51,540
can't

18528
01:52:53,790 --> 01:52:54,480
look

18529
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:55,200
into

18530
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:55,800
the

18531
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:56,280
future

18532
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:56,580
world

18533
01:52:56,580 --> 01:52:56,670
of

18534
01:52:56,670 --> 01:52:57,540
possibilities

18535
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:58,110
as

18536
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:58,860
effectively

18537
01:52:58,860 --> 01:52:59,670
there's

18538
01:52:59,730 --> 01:53:00,270
everything

18539
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,080
seems

18540
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:04,020
hopeless,

18541
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:04,230
and

18542
01:53:04,230 --> 01:53:04,350
what

18543
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:04,440
does

18544
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:04,560
that

18545
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:04,800
really

18546
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:05,160
mean?

18547
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:05,610
They,

18548
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:06,120
they

18549
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:06,720
discount

18550
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:06,810
the

01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,280
action,

18556
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:08,490
they

18557
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:09,030

18563
01:53:10,770 --> 01:53:10,950
at

18564
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:11,250
giving

18565
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:11,610
rise

18566
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:11,790

01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:12,390
that

18569
01:53:12,390 --> 01:53:12,900
matters.

18570
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:13,800
Everything

18571
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:14,220
seems

18572
01:53:14,220 --> 01:53:14,310
to

18573
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,550

18574
01:53:14,550 --> 01:53:14,820
out

18575
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:15,060

18576
01:53:15,060 --> 01:53:15,150
a

18586
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:17,490

18587
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:18,840
And

18588
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:20,400

01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:25,290
you

18601
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:25,500
will,

01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:25,590

up

18611
01:53:28,470 --> 01:53:28,710
doing

18612
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:28,830

01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:29,310
depression

18614
01:53:29,310 --> 01:53:29,430
is

18615
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:30,120
increasing

18616
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:30,540
the

18624
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:34,110

18633
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:39,210
That's

18634
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:39,360
a

18635
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:39,990
concept,

18636
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:40,110
it's

18637
01:53:40,110 --> 01:53:40,410
how I

18638
01:53:40,410 --> 01:53:40,650
think

18639
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:40,920
about

18640
01:53:40,920 --> 01:53:41,100
it.

18641
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:41,850
There

18642
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:41,940
are

18643
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,210
ways

18644
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:42,300
we

18645
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:42,480
can

18646
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:42,690
make

18647
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:42,930
that

18648
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:43,470
rigorous

18649
01:53:43,470 --> 01:53:43,950
we

18650
01:53:43,950 --> 01:53:44,310
can

18651
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,700
indeed

18652
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:45,600
identify

18653
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:45,780
in

18654
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:45,840
the

18656
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:46,440

18657
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,100
recording,

18658
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:47,220
we

18659
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:47,370
can

18660
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:47,580
see

18661
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:47,910
cells

18662
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:48,030
that

18663
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:48,660
represent

18664
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:49,800
steps

18665
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,070
along

01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,130

18668
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:51,300
and

18669
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:52,410
look

18670
01:53:52,410 --> 01:53:52,620

01:53:52,620 --> 01:53:52,680

18673
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:54,630
And

18674
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:54,750
we

18675
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:54,930
can

18676
01:53:54,930 --> 01:53:55,410
rigorously

18677
01:53:55,410 --> 01:53:55,800
define

18678
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:55,980
these

18680
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:56,850
and

18681
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:56,970
we

18682
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:57,120
can

18683
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:57,300
see

01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:57,420

18685
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:57,600
these

18686
01:53:57,600 --> 01:53:57,690

so

18692
01:53:59,520 --> 01:53:59,730
that's

01:53:59,730 --> 01:53:59,880

we're

01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:02,250

however,

01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:52,590
useful

18818
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,150
Why?

01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:57,990
Why

18820
01:54:57,990 --> 01:54:58,200
would

18823
01:54:59,250 --> 01:54:59,610
And

18824
01:54:59,610 --> 01:54:59,730
do

01:54:59,730 --> 01:54:59,850
you

01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,990
A

18830
01:55:01,950 --> 01:55:02,280
perhaps

18831
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:02,340
the

question

18835
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:03,600
is

18836
01:55:04,050 --> 01:55:05,070
psychedelics,

all

01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:07,320
those

01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:07,830
compounds

18842
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:08,190
there?

18843
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:08,760
In my

18844
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:08,970
mind,

18845
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:09,090
there

18846
01:55:09,090 --> 01:55:09,120
are

18847
01:55:09,120 --> 01:55:09,330
two

18848
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:10,050
components.

18849
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:10,320
There's

18850
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:10,410
the

18851
01:55:10,410 --> 01:55:10,920
experience

18852
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:11,010
you

18853
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:11,400
have

18854
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:11,700
while

18855
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:12,120
you're

18856
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:12,480
on

18857
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:12,720
them.

18858
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:12,960
And

18859
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:13,080
then

18860
01:55:13,080 --> 01:55:13,440
there's

18861
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:13,770
the

18862
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:14,220

01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:14,550

18865
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:15,120
after

18866
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:16,710
people

18867
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:16,890
are

18868
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:17,550

01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:18,390
these

01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:18,900

18878
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:22,380
But

18879
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:23,340
how

18880
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:23,820

you

18883
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:24,330

01:55:24,330 --> 01:55:24,690
it is

18887
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,190
Let's

18924
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:42,420
those

18925
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:43,050
experiences,

18926
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:43,410
that's

18927
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:43,680
that's

18928
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:43,800
the

18929
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:44,010
way I

18930
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,310
see

18931
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:44,490
it.

18932
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:44,970
And

18933
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:45,480
so

18934
01:55:45,510 --> 01:55:45,690
for

18935
01:55:45,690 --> 01:55:46,020
example,

18936
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:46,350
people

18937
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:46,590
on

18938
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:46,830
who've

18939
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:47,130
taken

18940
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:47,880
MDMA,

18941
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:48,630
they

18942
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:49,080
will,

18943
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:49,380
as

18944
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:49,440
you

18945
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:49,650
say,

18946
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:49,800
they'll

18947
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:50,040
have

18948
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:50,220
they'll

18949
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:50,580
be

18950
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:50,700
the

18951
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:51,150
acute

18952
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:51,690
phase

18953
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:51,900
of

18954
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:52,380
being

18955
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,100
on

18956
01:55:53,130 --> 01:55:53,670
the

18957
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:54,240
drug

18958
01:55:54,270 --> 01:55:54,570
and

18959
01:55:54,570 --> 01:55:55,410
experiencing

18960
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:55,770
the

18961
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,040
this

18962
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:56,610
extreme

18963
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,510
connectedness

18964
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:57,930
with

18965
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:58,230
other

18966
01:55:58,230 --> 01:55:58,620
people,

18967
01:55:58,620 --> 01:55:58,800
for

18968
01:55:58,800 --> 01:55:59,280
example.

18969
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:00,060
And

18970
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:00,210
then

18971
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:00,570
the

18972
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:01,140
drug

18973
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:02,310
wears

18974
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:02,850
off.

18975
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:03,840
And

18976
01:56:03,990 --> 01:56:04,380
but

18977
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:04,740
the

18978
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:05,070
brain

18979
01:56:05,070 --> 01:56:05,340
learn

18980
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:05,520
from

18981
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:05,640
that

18982
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:06,150
experience.

18983
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:06,270
And

18984
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:06,660
so

18985
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:07,080
what

18986
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:07,530
what

18987
01:56:07,770 --> 01:56:08,130
people

18988
01:56:08,130 --> 01:56:08,340
will

18989
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:08,790
report

18990
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:09,150
is,

18991
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:09,540
yeah,

18992
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:09,660
I'm

18993
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:09,990
not

18994
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:10,170
I'm

18995
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:10,320
not

18996
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:10,410
in

18997
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:10,560
that

18998
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:10,950
state.

18999
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:11,190
But I

19000
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:11,580
saw

19001
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:11,760
what

19002
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:11,880
was

19003
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:12,420
possible,

19004
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:12,540
you

19005
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:12,660
know,

19006
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:13,050
I saw

19007
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:13,410
Yeah,

19008
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:13,590
you

19009
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:13,920
can,

19010
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:15,840
there

19011
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:16,050
need

19012
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:16,650
to be

19013
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:17,400
barriers,

19014
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:17,670
or at

19015
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:17,910
least

19016
01:56:17,910 --> 01:56:18,090
not

19017
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:18,210
as

19018
01:56:18,210 --> 01:56:18,420
many

19019
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:18,930
barriers

19020
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:19,410
As I

19021
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:19,740
thought,

19022
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:20,310
I can

19023
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:20,760
connect

19024
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:20,850
with

19025
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:21,030
more

19026
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:21,420
people

19027
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:22,710
in a

19028
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:22,920
way

19029
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:23,280
that

19030
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:23,550
that

19031
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:23,670
is

19032
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:24,000
helpful.

19033
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:24,120
And

19034
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:24,270
so I

19035
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:24,510
think

19036
01:56:24,510 --> 01:56:25,200
it's

19037
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:25,290
the

19038
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:25,830
learning

19039
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:26,550
that

19040
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:27,000
happens

19041
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:27,090
in

19042
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:27,270
that

19043
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:27,750
state

19044
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,020
that

19045
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:28,620
actually

19046
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:29,400
matters.

19047
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:29,670
And

19048
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:29,820
this

19049
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:30,180
as

19050
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:30,330
you

19051
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:30,720
describe

19052
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:30,840
that,

19053
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:30,990
that

19054
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:31,230
sounds

19055
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:31,470
a lot

19056
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:31,740
like

19057
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:32,010
what

19058
01:56:32,010 --> 01:56:32,130
I

19059
01:56:32,130 --> 01:56:32,520
understand

19060
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:32,700
to be

19061
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:32,790
the

19062
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:33,240
hallmark

19063
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:33,570
feature

19064
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:33,720
of

19065
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:34,110
really

19066
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:34,380
good

19067
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:35,310
psychoanalysis

19068
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:35,460
that

19069
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:35,550
the

19070
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:36,180
relationship

19071
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:36,600
between

19072
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:37,410
patient

19073
01:56:37,410 --> 01:56:37,530
and

19074
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:38,220
therapist

19075
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,210
hopefully

19076
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:39,630
evolves

19077
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:39,750
to

19078
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:39,840
the

19079
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,200
point

19080
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:40,650
where

19081
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:42,540
these

19082
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:42,780
kinds

19083
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:42,870
of

19084
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:43,170
tests

19085
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:43,320
can

19086
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:43,470
be

19087
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:43,830
run

19088
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:44,190
within

19089
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:44,280
the

19090
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:44,820
context

19091
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:44,940
of

19092
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:45,150
that

19093
01:56:45,150 --> 01:56:45,840
relationship,

19094
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:45,990
and

19095
01:56:45,990 --> 01:56:46,140
then

19096
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:46,770
export

19097
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:47,310
it to

19098
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:47,520
other

19099
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:47,910
relations.

19100
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:48,150
That

19101
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:48,600
exactly

19102
01:56:48,600 --> 01:56:48,810
right.

19103
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:49,560
And

19104
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:49,830
that

19105
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:50,640
probably

19106
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:51,300
assuming

19107
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:51,420
is

19108
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:51,660
still

19109
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:51,750
the

19110
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:51,990
goal

19111
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,110
of

19112
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:52,350
really

19113
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:52,500
good

19114
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:53,220
psychiatry,

19115
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:53,670
also,

19116
01:56:53,849 --> 01:56:54,029
it's

19117
01:56:54,029 --> 01:56:54,089
a

19118
01:56:54,089 --> 01:56:54,389
part

19119
01:56:54,389 --> 01:56:54,689
of

19120
01:56:54,929 --> 01:56:55,949
intimacy,

19121
01:56:55,979 --> 01:56:56,429
really,

19122
01:56:56,699 --> 01:56:57,059
it

19123
01:56:57,059 --> 01:56:57,269
should

19124
01:56:57,269 --> 01:56:57,689
be,

19125
01:56:57,959 --> 01:56:58,409

01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:48,119
better.

19245
01:57:48,869 --> 01:57:49,349
And,

01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:27,090
to

19330
01:58:27,090 --> 01:58:27,540
not

19331
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,230
have

19332
01:58:28,230 --> 01:58:28,410
any

19333
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:28,590
of my

19334
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:29,190
scientific

19335
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:30,030
colleagues

19336
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:30,420
think

19337
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:30,540
oh,

19338
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:30,960
he's,

19339
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:31,560
he's

19340
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:31,770
going

19341
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:31,950
too

19342
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:32,310
far

19343
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:32,670
using

19344
01:58:32,670 --> 01:58:32,820
too

19345
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:33,060
much.

19346
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,150
And

19347
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:33,300
so I

19348
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:33,480
had

19349
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:33,960
these

19350
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:34,350
these

19351
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:34,560
two

19352
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:34,950
goals,

19353
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:35,130
which

19354
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:35,220
I

19355
01:58:35,220 --> 01:58:35,520
kept

19356
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:35,610
an

19357
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:35,640
eye

19358
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:35,880
on my

19359
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:36,210
mind

19360
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:36,330
the

19361
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:36,720
entire

19362
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,080
time.

19363
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:37,410
And a

19364
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:37,620
lot

19365
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:37,710
of

19366
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:37,980
this

19367
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:38,280
trying

19368
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:38,340
to

19369
01:58:38,340 --> 01:58:38,670
find

19370
01:58:38,670 --> 01:58:39,090
exactly

19371
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:39,210
the

19372
01:58:39,210 --> 01:58:39,390
right

19373
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:39,690
word

19374
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:39,810
we

19375
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:40,080
talked

19376
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,350
about

19377
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:40,620
was

19378
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:41,490
on

19379
01:58:41,490 --> 01:58:41,640
this

19380
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,060
path

19381
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:42,180
of

19382
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:42,690
staying

19383
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,650
excruciating

19384
01:58:43,650 --> 01:58:43,950
Lee

19385
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:44,520
rigorous

19386
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:44,640
in

19387
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:44,700
the

19388
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:45,120
science

19389
01:58:45,120 --> 01:58:45,240
and

19390
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:45,630
yet,

19391
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:46,650
letting

19392
01:58:46,650 --> 01:58:46,950
people

19393
01:58:46,950 --> 01:58:47,220
see

19394
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:47,310
the

19395
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:47,670
hope

19396
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,420
the

19397
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:48,870
where

19398
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,200
things

19399
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:49,650
were

19400
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:50,370
everybody

19401
01:58:50,370 --> 01:58:50,880
see

19402
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:51,300
that

19403
01:58:51,330 --> 01:58:51,570
we've

19404
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:51,750
come

19405
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:51,810
a

19406
01:58:51,810 --> 01:58:51,990
long

19407
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,140
way,

19408
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:52,230
we

19409
01:58:52,230 --> 01:58:52,350
have

19410
01:58:52,350 --> 01:58:52,410
a

19411
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:52,620
long

19412
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:52,770
way

19413
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:52,860
to

19414
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:53,340
go.

19415
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:54,660
But,

19416
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:55,140
but

19417
01:58:55,140 --> 01:58:55,410
the

19418
01:58:55,440 --> 01:58:56,280
trajectory

19419
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:56,460
and

19420
01:58:56,460 --> 01:58:56,790
the

19421
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:57,360
path

19422
01:58:57,390 --> 01:58:57,900
is

19423
01:58:57,900 --> 01:58:58,350
beautiful.

19424
01:58:58,380 --> 01:58:58,620
And

19425
01:58:58,620 --> 01:58:58,860
so

19426
01:58:58,860 --> 01:58:59,340
that,

19427
01:58:59,370 --> 01:58:59,700
that

19428
01:58:59,730 --> 01:58:59,970
that

19429
01:58:59,970 --> 01:59:00,150
was

19430
01:59:00,150 --> 01:59:00,630
the

19431
01:59:00,690 --> 01:59:01,140
goal,

19432
01:59:01,140 --> 01:59:01,710
I

19433
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:02,280
think,

19434
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:03,480
you

19435
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:03,720
know,

19436
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:04,800
of

19437
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:05,070
course,

19438
01:59:05,070 --> 01:59:05,220
that

19439
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:05,520
sounds

19440
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:05,760
almost

19441
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:06,450
impossible

19442
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:06,810
to

19443
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:08,130
jointly

19444
01:59:08,130 --> 01:59:08,670
satisfy

19445
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:08,940
those

19446
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:09,420
two,

19447
01:59:09,870 --> 01:59:10,110
those

19448
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:10,260
two

19449
01:59:10,260 --> 01:59:10,620
goals,

19450
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:11,160
but I

19451
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:11,460
kept

19452
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:11,580
that

19453
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:11,790
in my

19454
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:12,090
mind

19455
01:59:12,090 --> 01:59:12,180
the

19456
01:59:12,180 --> 01:59:12,510
whole

19457
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:12,690
way

19458
01:59:12,690 --> 01:59:12,930
through.

19459
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:13,080
And

19460
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:13,290
yes,

19461
01:59:13,290 --> 01:59:13,680
I am

19462
01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:14,340
optimistic.

19463
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:14,700
And I

19464
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:14,910
hope

19465
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:15,090
that

19466
01:59:15,090 --> 01:59:15,300
came

19467
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:15,510
through

19468
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:15,600
in

19469
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:15,690
the

19470
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:15,990
book,

19471
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:16,530
but

19472
01:59:16,530 --> 01:59:16,680
it

19473
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:17,040
certainly

19474
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:17,340
did.

19475
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:17,490
And

19476
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:17,580
at

19477
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:17,760
least

19478
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:17,940
from

19479
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,120
this

19480
01:59:18,120 --> 01:59:18,750
colleague,

19481
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:20,790
you,

19482
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:21,330
you

19483
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:21,600
did

19484
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:22,020
achieve

19485
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:22,500
both.

19486
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:23,100
And

19487
01:59:23,610 --> 01:59:23,850
it's

19488
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:23,910
a

19489
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:24,600
wonderful,

19490
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:24,930
it's

19491
01:59:24,930 --> 01:59:24,990
a

19492
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:25,680
masterful

19493
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:26,040
book,

19494
01:59:26,070 --> 01:59:26,520
really,

19495
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:26,790
and

19496
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:27,030
one

19497
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,300
that

19498
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:27,720
as a

19499
01:59:27,720 --> 01:59:28,380
scientist,

19500
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:28,710
and

19501
01:59:29,010 --> 01:59:29,340
somebody

19502
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:29,460
who

19503
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:29,670
is a

19504
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:30,090
Brit,

19505
01:59:30,690 --> 01:59:31,020
fellow

19506
01:59:31,020 --> 01:59:31,290
brain

19507
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:31,980
Explorer,

19508
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:32,910
hits

19509
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:33,120
all

19510
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,240
the

19511
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:33,810
marks

19512
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:34,530
of

19513
01:59:34,530 --> 01:59:35,010
rigor

19514
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:35,250
and

19515
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:35,370
is

19516
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:36,030
incredibly

19517
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:36,480
interesting.

19518
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:36,600
And

19519
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:36,810
there's

19520
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:37,020
a ton

19521
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:37,110
of

19522
01:59:37,110 --> 01:59:37,860
storytelling.

19523
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:37,920
I

19524
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:38,010
don't

19525
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:38,130
want

19526
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:38,190
to

19527
01:59:38,190 --> 01:59:38,310
give

19528
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:38,490
away

19529
01:59:38,490 --> 01:59:38,640
too

19530
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:38,850
much

19531
01:59:38,850 --> 01:59:39,180
