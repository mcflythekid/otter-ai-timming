00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,740
because

hacked.

462
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:33,480
I

463
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,690
still

464
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:33,840
don't

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,380
exactly

467
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:34,530
how

468
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:34,590
it

469
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,040
happened.

470
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,220
But

471
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,280
it

472
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,460
was

473
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:35,670
an

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,210
absolute

475
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:36,690
mess.

476
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,260
I

477
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:37,530
lost

478
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,010
money,

479
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,130
I

480
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,400
lost

481
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,670
a lot

482
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,730
of

483
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,300
time,

484
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,810
I

485
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,020
wouldn't

486
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,140
want

487
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,200
to

488
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,380
have

489
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,440
it

490
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:40,740
happen

491
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:40,830
to

492
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,430
anybody.

493
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,240
When

494
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,420
that

495
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:42,840
happened,

496
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:42,990
I

497
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,290
talked

498
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,470
to my

499
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,770
friends

500
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:43,860
in

501
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,920
the

502
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,130
tech

503
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,670
community.

504
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:44,790
And

505
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,880
they

506
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,090
told

507
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,210
me

508
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:45,420
that

509
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:45,780
even

510
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,170
though

511
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,560
you

512
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:46,920
think

513
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,160
your

514
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,550
internet

515
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,030
connection

516
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,210
is

517
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:48,600
secure,

518
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
oftentimes,

519
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,350
it's

520
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,800
not.

521
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,550
So I

522
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,760
tend

523
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:50,820
to

524
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:50,970
use

525
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,390
internet

526
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,870
connections

527
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,050
on

528
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,560
planes,

529
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,680
in

530
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,460
hotels,

531
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:53,790
in

532
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,480
cafes,

533
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,930
but

534
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,140
also

535
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,230
at

536
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,740
home.

537
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,130
And I

538
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,250
was

539
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,430
told

540
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,520
that

541
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:56,760
even

542
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:56,880
at

543
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,360
home,

544
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:57,930
your

545
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,230
data

546
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,470
may

547
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,680
not

548
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,890
be as

549
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,220
secure

550
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,370
as

551
00:02:59,370 --> 00:02:59,520
you

552
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,000
think.

553
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,600
And

554
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:00,840
so

555
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:00,990
with

556
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,980
ExpressVPN,

557
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,130
your

558
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,400
data

559
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,520
is

560
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,150
absolutely

561
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:03,660
secure.

562
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:03,960
So

563
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,140
your

564
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,560

566
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:05,730
The

567
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:05,940
great

568
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,120
thing

569
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,420
is,

570
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:06,660
you

571
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,810
don't

572
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,020
even

573
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,350
notice

574
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:07,530
that

575
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:07,860
it's

576
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,670
operating,

577
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:08,940
it's

578
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,270
running

579
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,360

582
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,320
you

583
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,530
just

584
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:10,740
turn

585
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:10,860
it

586
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,220
on,

587
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,460
and

588
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:11,610
it

589
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,000
goes

590
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,330
without

591
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:12,450
you

592
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:12,990
realizing

593
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,080
that

594
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,200
your

595
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,410

596
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:13,500
is

597
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:13,680
being

598
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,280
protected.

599
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:14,580
It

600
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,850
doesn't

601
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,300
interfere

602
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,450

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,630

608
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,970
So I

609
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,210
use

and

773
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,160
then

774
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,250
at

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:14,460
night

776
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,580

781
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:15,990
because

782
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,080
it

783
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,680

788
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,360

799
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:22,290
or

800
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:22,710
sometimes

801
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,890
even

802
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:23,070

806
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,330
And

807
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:24,390
the

808
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,660
reason

like

811
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,320
it is

812
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:25,620
because

813
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:25,710

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,660
it's

819
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,230
compatible

820
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,440

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:40,890
In my

1186
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,500
For

1188
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,220

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,200
readily,

1196
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,440
in

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:37,650

1201
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,450
deeply,

1202
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:39,840
in

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:42,960
It

1211
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,200
also

1212
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,470
seems

1213
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:43,590
to

1214
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,980

1217
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,420
it

1218
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,540
can

1219
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,110
enhance

that.

1236
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,500
There's

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,730
doesn't

1279
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,240
contain

1280
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,600
any

1281
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,720
of

1282
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,050
the

1283
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,370
intentions,

1284
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:11,640
or

1285
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:11,790
some

1286
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:11,850
of

1287
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:11,910
the

1288
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,090
more

1289
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,570

nidra.

1294
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,490
Instead,

1295
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:14,670
it's

1296
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,210
focused

1297
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,960
purely

1298
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,380
on

1299
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,590

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,450
well

1304
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:18,570

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,460
It

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:26,910
but

1332
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,270

1333
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,930
distinct

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,260

1337
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,670
I

1338
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,880
just

1339
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,150
offer

1340
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,300
this

1341
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,390
to

1342
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,600
you

1343
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:30,810
as a

1344
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,260
resource,

1345
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,350
if

1346
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,470
you'd

1347
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:31,620
like

1348
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:31,740
to

1349
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:31,980
use

1350
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,220
it,

1351
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:32,490
it's

1352
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:32,700
about

1353
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,030
30

1354
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:33,330
minutes

1355
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,780
long,

1356
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,170
and

1357
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,320
should

1358
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,380
be

1359
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,650
very

1360
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,100
effective

1361
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,190
in

1362
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,460
bringing

1363
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:35,550
you

1364
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:35,790
into

1365
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,030
deep

1366
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,330
states

1367
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:36,420
of

1368
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,290
relaxation

1369
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:37,530
for

1370
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:37,650
all

1371
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:37,740
the

1372
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,070
reasons

1373
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,130
I

1374
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,490
mentioned

1375
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:38,970
before.

1376
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,230
So

1377
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,440
let's

1378
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:40,650
talk

1379
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:40,860
about

1380
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,580
emotions.

1381
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,330
Emotions

1382
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:42,510
are a

1383
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,470
fascinating

1384
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,650
and

1385
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,040
vital

1386
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,550
aspect

1387
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,670
of

1388
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,760
our

1389
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,030
life

1390
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,840
experience.

1391
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:46,710
It's

1392
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,980
fair

1393
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,070
to

1394
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,250
say

1395
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,400
that

1396
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,940
emotions

1397
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,180
make

1398
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,360
up

1399
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,780
most

1400
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:48,900
of

1401
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,080
what

1402
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,200
we

1403
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,500
think

1404
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,070
of as

1405
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,220
our

1406
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,880
experience

1407
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,000
of

1408
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,510
life,

1409
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,200
even

1410
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:52,260
the

1411
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,530
things

1412
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,280
we do

1413
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:53,490
our

1414
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,210
behaviors

1415
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:54,330
and

1416
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:54,420
the

1417
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,750
places

1418
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:54,900
we

1419
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,260
go,

1420
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:55,380
and

1421
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,470
the

1422
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:55,770
people

1423
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,040
we

1424
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,400
end

1425
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,520
up

1426
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,060
encountering

1427
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,150
in

1428
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,300
our

1429
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,660
life.

1430
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:58,980
All

1431
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,070
of

1432
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,280
that

1433
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,580
really

1434
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,090
funnels

1435
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,630
into

1436
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:00,870
our

1437
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,470
emotional

1438
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,220
perception

1439
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,640
of

1440
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:02,850
what

1441
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,120
those

1442
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,420
things

1443
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,990
mean,

1444
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,380
whether

1445
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,410
or

1446
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:04,560
not

1447
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:04,650
they

1448
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,830
made

1449
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:04,920
us

1450
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,460
happy,

1451
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:05,670
or

1452
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,180
sad,

1453
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:06,360
or

1454
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,020
depressed

1455
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,200
or

1456
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,800
lonely,

1457
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,640
or

1458
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,120
were

1459
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,390
all

1460
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,230
inspiring.

1461
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:10,800
Now,

1462
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:10,980
one

1463
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,220
thing

1464
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,400
that

1465
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,670
is

1466
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,300
absolutely

1467
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,600
true

1468
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:12,780
is

1469
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:12,960
that

1470
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,440
everyone's

1471
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,220
perception

1472
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:14,400
of

1473
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,790
emotion

1474
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,910
is

1475
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,360
slightly

1476
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,900
different.

1477
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,890
Meaning,

1478
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,880
your

1479
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,330
idea

1480
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:18,420
of

1481
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,840
happy

1482
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:18,990
is

1483
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,320
very

1484
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,710
likely

1485
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,220

happiness

1495
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,460
is.

1496
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,270
And

1497
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,450
we

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:24,630
know

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:24,810
this

1500
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,440

00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,050
even

1507
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,260
though

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,540
We

00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:36,690
can

1533
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,810
be

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,380

going

1554
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,080
to be

1555
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,260
very

1556
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,530
different

1557
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:46,680

red

1565
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,050
if we

1566
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,140
were

1567
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,410
given

1568
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:49,440
a

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,010
selection

1570
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,340
of 10

1571
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,640

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,030
reds

1573
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,150
and

1574
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,420
asked

1575
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,630
which

1576
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:51,780
one

1577
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:51,900
is

1578
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,140
most

1579
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,650
intense,

1580
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:52,890
which

1581
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,130
one

1582
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,670
looks

1583
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,150
most

1584
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,630
red.

1585
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,230
And

1586
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,380
that

1587
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,770
seems

1588
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,310
crazy.

1589
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:56,610
You

1590
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:56,700
would

1591
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:56,940
think

1592
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,090
that

1593
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,450
something

1594
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:57,600
as

1595
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:57,990
simple

1596
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,140
as

1597
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,620
color

1598
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:58,950
would

1599
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,040
be

1600
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,670
universal,

1601
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,790
and

1602
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,000
yet

1603
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,180
it's

1604
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,720
not.

1605
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,530
And

1606
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,860
so we

1607
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,010
need

1608
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,130
to

1609
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,550
agree

1610
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,640
at

1611
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,760
the

1612
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,330
outset,

1613
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:03,960
that

1614
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,410
emotions

1615
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,500
are

1616
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,250
complicated,

1617
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:05,820
and

1618
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,210
yet

1619
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:06,540
they

1620
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,780
are

1621
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,440
tractable,

1622
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,560
they

1623
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:07,920
can

1624
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,070
be

1625
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,640
understood.

1626
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:08,760
And

1627
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:08,970
today

1628
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,120
we're

1629
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,330
going

1630
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:09,450
to

1631
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:09,690
talk

1632
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:09,990
about

1633
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,380
a lot

1634
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,530
of

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
understand

1638
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:12,690
what

1639
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,230
emotions

1640
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,620
are

1641
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,070
for

1642
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,280
you

1643
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,370
to

1644
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,000

and

1651
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,040

1652
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,160
they

1653
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,460
don't

1654
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,850
mean.

1655
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:18,390
And

1656
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,480
in

1657
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,750

emotion,

1795
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,270
because

1796
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,720
nowadays,

1797
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:06,870
we

1798
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,320
understand

1799
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,710
a lot

1800
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:07,980
about

1801
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,070
the

1802
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,700
chemicals

1803
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:08,850
and

1804
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:08,910
the

1805
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,480
hormones

1806
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:09,660
and

1807
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:09,720
the

1808
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,110
neural

1809
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,650
circuits

1810
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:10,740
in

1811
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,830
the

1812
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,040
brain

1813
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,130
and

1814

1815
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:11,910
that

1816
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,480
underlie

emotion.

1818
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,410
So

1819
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:13,590
while

1820
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,800
there's

1821
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,190
no

1822
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:14,610

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,900
universally

1825
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,170
true

1826
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:16,650
theory

1827
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:16,740
of

1828
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,310
emotion,

1829
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:17,910
at

1830
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,060
the

1831
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,840
intersection

1832
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:18,960
of

1833
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,230
many

1834
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,290
of

1835
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:19,380
the

1836
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,860
existing

1837
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,370
theories,

1838
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:20,820
there

1839
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,090
really

1840
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,270
some

1841
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,660
ground

1842
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:21,930
truth.

1843
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,080
So

1844
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,350
today,

1845
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,530
we're

1846
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:22,680
going

1847
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:22,740
to

1848
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,040
visit

1849
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,250
those

1850
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,580
ground

1851
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,030
truths.

1852
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,360
We're

1853
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,480
going

1854
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:24,540
to

1855
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:24,720

1856
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:24,900
about

1857
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:24,990
the

that

1860
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,680
emerged

1861
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:25,860
from

1862
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,130
them.

1863
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,640
And

1864
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:26,730
we're

1865
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:26,850
going

1866
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:26,910
to

1867
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,090

1868
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,300
about

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:27,450
some

wild

1872
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:28,710
and

1873
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,160
wacky

1874
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,700

00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:37,800
actually

1904
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:37,920
going

1905
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,160
to do

1906
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,340
some

1907
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,060
experiential

1908
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,360
stuff

1909
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,660
today,

1910
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:39,750
if

1911
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,870
you

1912
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,170
like.

1913
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:40,350
There's

1914
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,500
some

1915
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,710
things

1916
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,800
that

1917
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:40,890
you

1918
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,010
can

1919
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,250
do in

1920
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,520
real

1921
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,120
time,

1922
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,020
while

1923
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,410
listening

1924
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,500
to

1925
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,590
the

1926
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,370
podcast,

1927
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:44,700
in

1928
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,000
order

1929
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,360
to

1930
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:45,870
tap

1931
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,140
into

1932
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,320
some

1933
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,410
of

1934
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,470
the

1935
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,130
mechanisms

1936
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,280
that

1937
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,370
I'll

1938
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,520
be

1939
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,970
referring

1940
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,180
to.

1941
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,330
So

1942
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:48,630
today's

1943
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,750
can

1944
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:48,840
be

1945
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,080
very

1946
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,770
interactive

1947
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:49,890
in a

1948
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,070
way

1949
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,190
that

1950
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:50,550
previous

1951
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,030
podcast

1952
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,540
episodes

1953
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,750
have

1954
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,140
not.

1955
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,010
If we

1956
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:53,250
want

1957
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,340
to

1958
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,910
understand

1959
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,570
emotions,

1960
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,170
we

1961
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,380
have

1962
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,500
to

1963
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,710
look

1964
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:55,800
at

1965
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,010
where

1966
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,550
emotions

1967
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,880
first

1968
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,450
develop.

1969
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:57,810
In

1970
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,080
fact,

1971
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,320
this

1972
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,680
is a

1973
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,340
critical

1974
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,790
central

1975
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,150
theme.

1976
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,270
If

1977
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,360
you

1978
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,660
want

1979
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:00,750
to

1980
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,290
understand

1981
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,620
brain

1982
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,040
science

1983
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,160
and

1984
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,910
psychology,

1985
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:03,720
there's

1986
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:03,780
a

1987
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,380
rule

1988
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,560
in

1989
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,430
neuroanatomy.

1990
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,570
Because

1991
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:06,690
if

1992
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:06,810
you

1993
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,170
look

1994
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,830
at 50

1995
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,130
Different

1996
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,580
Brains

1997
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:08,700
of

1998
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,180
humans,

1999
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,270
or

2000
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,360
you

2001
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,780
compare

2002
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:09,870
the

2003
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,500
brains

2004
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:10,800
of

2005
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,340
dogs

2006
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,460
and

2007
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:11,940
humans,

2008
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,240
there

2009
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,300
are a

2010
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,510
lot

2011
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:12,570
of

2012
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:13,290
differences.

2013
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:13,800
Certain

2014
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:13,980
things

2015
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,040
are

2016
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,130
the

2017
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,400
same,

2018
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,520
but

2019
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:14,760
certain

2020
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:14,970
things

2021
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,060
are

2022
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,510
different.

2023
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,170
And

2024
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,290
the

2025
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,890
rule

2026
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,220
that

2027
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,430
every

2028
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,610
good,

2029
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,360
neuroanatomist

2030
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,810
knows

2031
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:18,990
is

2032
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,140
that

2033
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,260
if

2034
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,350
you

2035
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,590
want

2036
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,680
to

2037
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,430
understand

2038
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:20,700
what

2039
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:20,850
a

2040
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,150
part

2041
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,240
of

2042
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,300
the

2043
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:21,600
brain

2044
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,050
does,

2045
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:22,560
you

2046
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:22,680
have

2047
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:22,770
to

2048
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,070
address

2049
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,250
two

2050
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:23,880
questions.

2051
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,390
First,

2052
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:24,570
you

2053
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:24,690
have

2054
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:24,780
to

2055
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,110
know

2056
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,680
what

2057
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,310
connections

2058
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,490
does

2059
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,670
that

2060
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:26,910
brain

2061
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,210
area

2062
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:27,630
make?

2063
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,770
What

2064
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,070
is it

2065
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,490
connected

2066
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:29,610
to?

2067
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,850
Where

2068
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:30,000
does

2069
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,090
it

2070
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,270
get

2071
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,720
inputs

2072
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,170
from?

2073
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,650
And

2074
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:31,890
where

2075
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,130
does

2076
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,340
it

2077
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,880
send

2078
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,450
inputs.

2079
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:33,840
So

2080
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,020
for

2081
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,560
instance,

2082
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:34,770
if

2083
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:34,950
there's

2084
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,040
an

2085
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,310
area

2086
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:35,400
of

2087
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,460
the

2088
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,820
brain

2089
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:35,910
that

2090
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,180
gets

2091
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,690
direct

2092
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,290
input

2093
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:37,770
from

2094
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:37,860
the

2095
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,280
neurons

2096
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,400
in

2097
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,490
the

2098
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,120
nose,

2099
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,050
you

2100
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,260
can

2101
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,410
be

2102
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:40,740
pretty

2103
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,130
certain

2104
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:41,280
that

2105
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,400
it

2106
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,700
has

2107
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,090
some

2108
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:42,570
role

2109
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,780
in

2110
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,470
analyzing

2111
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,070
smell

2112
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,490
in

2113
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,240
measuring

2114
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:45,810
something

2115
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,080
about

2116
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,530
odors,

2117
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:46,620
or

2118
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,190
analyzing

2119
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,550
something

2120
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:47,790
about

2121
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,300
odors.

2122
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,690
Now,

2123
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:48,840
if it

2124
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,110
also

2125
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,320
gets

2126
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,680
input

2127
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,860
from

2128
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:49,980
the

2129
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:50,550
eye,

2130
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:50,910
you

2131
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,060
can

2132
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,330
also

2133
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:51,750
conclude

2134
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,900
that

2135
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:51,990
it

2136
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,200
gets

2137
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,710
input

2138
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,190
from

2139
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,280
the

2140
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,550
visual

2141
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:53,940
system

2142
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,090
that

2143
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,180
it

2144
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,570
cares

2145
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,200
about

2146
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,160
light

2147
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,280
and

2148
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:56,970
photons,

2149
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,240
this

2150
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,300
is

2151
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,510
sort

2152
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:57,570
of

2153
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,170
obvious.

2154
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:58,530
And

2155
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:58,650
yet,

2156
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:58,740
you

2157
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:58,950
need

2158
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,040
to

2159
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,250
know

2160
00:11:59,250 --> 00:11:59,460
that

2161
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,270
connectivity.

2162
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:00,990
And

2163
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,140
you

2164
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,470
need

2165
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:01,590
to

2166
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,040
know

2167
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,760
what's

2168
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,180
called

2169
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,450
the

2170
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,170
developmental

2171
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,830
origin

2172
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:04,920
of

2173
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,130
that

2174
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:05,610
structure,

2175
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:05,760
you

2176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:05,910
need

2177
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,970
to

2178
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,120
know

2179
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,570
where

2180
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:06,660
it

2181
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,020
was

2182
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,440
early

2183
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,560
in

2184
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,280
development.

2185
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,180
Because

2186
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,510
things

2187
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:09,780
move

2188
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,230
around

2189
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,560
a lot

2190
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,680
as

2191
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:10,770
the

2192
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,040
brain

2193
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,580
develops,

2194
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:11,760
the

2195
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,090
brain,

2196
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,180
of

2197
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,480
course,

2198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,570
is

2199
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:12,810
this

2200
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,350
more

2201
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,380
or

2202
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,560
less

2203
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,040
squishy

2204
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,430
thing

2205
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,090
floating

2206
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,360
around

2207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,450
in

2208
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:15,600
some

2209
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:15,990
liquid

2210
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,110
that

2211
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,470
stuffed

2212
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,800
inside

2213
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:16,980
your

2214
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,670
skull.

2215
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,090
And

2216
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,270
as a

2217
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,810
consequence,

2218
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:19,080
things

2219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,350
move

2220
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,800
around

2221
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:19,830
a

2222
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,130
lot,

2223
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:20,250
they

2224
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:20,340
are

2225
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,550
not

2226
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,790
always

2227
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,910
in

2228
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,000
the

2229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,270
same

2230
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,660
place

2231
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:21,780
in

2232
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,200
two

2233
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:22,950
different

2234
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,580
species,

2235
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,780
or to

2236
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,320
individuals

2237
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,410
of

2238
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:25,470
the

2239
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:25,710
same

2240
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,310
species.

2241
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:26,850
So

2242
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:26,970
you

2243
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:27,060
have

2244
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,150
to

2245
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,270
know

2246
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:27,480
where

2247
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:27,600
they

2248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,140
started

2249
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,470
out,

2250
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,770
because

2251
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:28,980
where

2252
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,100
they

2253
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,520
started

2254
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,790
out

2255
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,270
informs

2256
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,480
what

2257
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:30,570
they

2258
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:30,930
do as

2259
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,320
well.

2260
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,100
And

2261
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,220
when

2262
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,310
we're

2263
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,520
talking

2264
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,670
about

2265
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,360
emotions,

2266
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:33,750
we

2267
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,320
cannot

2268
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,770
point

2269
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,040
to

2270
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,340
one

2271
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,610
area

2272
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:35,700
of

2273
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:35,790
the

2274
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,060
brain,

2275
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,150
we

2276
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,360
can't

2277
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:36,570
say

2278
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,960
that's

2279
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,290
the

2280
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,680
area

2281
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,740
of

2282
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:37,830
the

2283
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,040
brain

2284
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,190
that's

2285
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:38,910
responsible

2286
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,090
for

2287
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,720
emotions.

2288
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,170
There

2289
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:40,290
is

2290
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:40,440
this

2291
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,560
so

2292
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:40,800
called

2293
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,310
limbic

2294
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:41,940
system

2295
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:42,630
that

2296
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:42,960
has

2297
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,350
been

2298
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:43,920
linked

2299
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,250
to

2300
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:44,820
emotions

2301
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:44,940
in

2302
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,330
various

2303
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:45,600
ways.

2304
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,720
We're

2305
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:45,840
going

2306
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:45,900
to

2307
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,200
talk

2308
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,440
about

2309
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,650
that

2310
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,070
today.

2311
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:47,760
But

2312
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:47,850
the

2313
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,210
limbic

2314
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:48,540
system

2315
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:48,630
is

2316
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:48,960
just

2317
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,380
one

2318
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,280
component

2319
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,460
of

2320
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:50,610
the

2321
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,090
inputs

2322
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,390
to

2323
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,870
create

2324
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,410
emotions.

2325
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,560
It's

2326
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:52,920
not

2327
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,670
the

2328
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,120
place

2329
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,450
for

2330
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,020
emotions,

2331
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,200
you

2332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,440
can't

2333
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:55,680
go in

2334
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:55,770
and

2335
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,190
lesion

2336
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,460
one

2337
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,000
location

2338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,120
in

2339
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,180
the

2340
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,660
brain

2341
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,230
and

2342
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,890
eliminate

2343
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,610
emotions

2344
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,090
entirely

2345
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,450
just

2346
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:00,720
doesn't

2347
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:00,990
work

2348
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,170
that

2349
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,470
way.

2350
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,760
So,

2351
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,420
first

2352
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,480
of

2353
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:03,810
all,

2354
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,200
we

2355
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,320
have

2356
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,410
to

2357
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,920
ask,

2358
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,640
what

2359
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,730
are

2360
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:05,850
the

2361
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,540
circuits

2362
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:06,720
for

2363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,200
emotion?

2364
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,350
What

2365
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,410
are

2366
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:07,530
the

2367
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:07,920
brain

2368
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,250
areas

2369
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,400
for

2370
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,790
emotion

2371
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,880
and

2372
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,390
nowadays,

2373
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:09,570
there's

2374
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:09,990
a lot

2375
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,080
of

2376
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,560
debate

2377
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:10,860
about

2378
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,040
this.

2379
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,190
For

2380
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,820
years,

2381
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,150
there

2382
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,300
was

2383
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,630
thought

2384
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:12,750
that

2385
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:12,870
there

2386
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,110
might

2387
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,260
be

2388
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,100
circuits,

2389
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,610
meaning

2390
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,120
connections

2391
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,210
in

2392
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,270
the

2393
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,540
brain

2394
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:15,690
that

2395
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,110
generate

2396
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,170
the

2397
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:16,500
feeling

2398
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,590
of

2399
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:16,770
being

2400
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,250
happy,

2401
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,430
or

2402
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,940
circuits

2403
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,060
that

2404
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,390
generate

2405
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:18,450
the

2406
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:18,780
feeling

2407
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:18,870
of

2408
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,080
being

2409
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,620
sad,

2410
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,250
etc.

2411
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,600
That's

2412
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,750
been

2413
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,350
challenged.

2414
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:22,470
In

2415
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,890
fact,

2416
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:23,730
Lisa

2417
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,120

Barrett

2419
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:24,900

2420
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,050
been

2421
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,110
the

2422
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,500
person

2423
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:25,770
who's

2424
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,010
really

2425
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,520
challenged

2426
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:26,670
this

2427
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:26,910
head

2428
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,270
on,

2429
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:27,660
and

2430
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:27,810
has

2431
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,020
very

2432
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,170
good

2433
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:28,560
evidence

2434
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,680
for

2435
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,740
the

2436
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,100
fact

2437
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,310
that

2438
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,580
such

2440
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,540
probably

2441
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,840
don't

2442
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,440
exist.

2443
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:31,920
And

2444
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,220
yet,

2445
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,460
I

2446
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:32,640
think

2447
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:32,820
there's

2448
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,060

more

attention

2491
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:48,060
to

2492
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,270
what's

00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:48,540
going

2498
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,670
If

this

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,510
sense

2504
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:51,660
right

2505
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:51,840
now,

2506
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:51,900
I

2507
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,290

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,380
it

2509
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,500
will

2510
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:52,680

00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,370
soon.

2513
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:53,880
But

2514
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:53,970
the

2515
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,270
important

2516
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,420
thing

2517
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,480
to

2518
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,990
understand

2519
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,140
is

2520
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:55,440
that

00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,520

2522
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:56,760

00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:57,870
brain

2527
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:57,990
and

2528
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,440
body.

2529
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,580
They

2530
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,060
arise

2531
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:00,360
because

2532
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:00,510
there

2533
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:00,600
are

2534
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,080
specific

2535
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,530
connections

2536
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:01,980
between

2537
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,490
specific

2538
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,970
areas

2539
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,060
in

2540
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,120
the

2541
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,330
brain

2542
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:03,450
and

2543
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:03,840
body.

2544
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,410
And

2545
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:04,620
if we

2546
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:04,920
want

2547
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:04,980
to

2548
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,550
understand

2549
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,000
how

2550
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,990
emotions

2551
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,620
work,

2552
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:07,830
we

2553
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,100
have

2554
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,220
to

2555
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,430
look

2556
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:08,790
how

2557
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,330
emotions

2558
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:09,540
are

2559
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,050
built.

2560
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:10,920
And

2561
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,070
they

2562
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,220
are

2563
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,820
built

2564
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,050
during

2565
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,800
infancy,

2566
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,240
adolescence,

2567
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,960
and

2568
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,530
puberty,

2569
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,950
and

2570
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,130
then

2571
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,220
it

2572
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,760
continues

2573
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:17,970
into

2574
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,480
adulthood,

2575
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:18,780
but

2576
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:18,930
the

2577
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,650
groundwork

2578
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:19,800
is

2579
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,040
laid

2580
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,430
down

2581
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,850
early

2582
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:20,910
in

2583
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,390
development

2584
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,720
when

2585
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:21,930
we

2586
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,050
are

2587
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,380
small

2588
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,890
children.

2589
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,520
So

2590
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:23,730
let's

2591
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:23,970
think

2592
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:24,180
about

2593
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,300
what

2594
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,630
happens

2595
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:24,810
to a

2596
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:25,230
baby

2597
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,380
that

2598
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:25,650
comes

2599
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:25,860
into

2600
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:25,950
the

2601
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,400
world.

2602
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,150
A

2603
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,630
baby

2604
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:27,870
comes

2605
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,050
into

2606
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:28,110
the

2607
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,410
world

2608
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:28,560
you

2609
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,680
were

2610
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:28,950
born

2611
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,130
into

2612
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,310
this

2613
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,760
world,

2614
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,630
without

2615
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,200
really

2616
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,530
any

2617
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,550
understanding

2618
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:32,910
of

2619
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:32,970
the

2620
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,270
things

2621
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:33,690
around

2622
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:33,930
you.

2623
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,500
Now,

2624
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:34,650
there

2625
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:34,710
are

2626
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,920
two

2627
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,190
ways

2628
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,310
that

2629
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,400
you

2630
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,550
can

2631
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,060
interact

2632
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,210
with

2633
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,270
the

2634
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,660
world

2635
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:36,810
and

2636
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:36,930
you're

2637
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,200
always

2638
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,410
doing

2639
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:37,530
them

2640
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:37,800
more

2641
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:37,860
or

2642
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,310
less,

2643
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,970
to

2644
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:39,240
some

2645
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,660
degree

2646
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:39,870
at

2647
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:39,930
the

2648
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,320
same

2649
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
time.

2650
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,540
Those

2651
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:42,780
are

2652
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,770
interoception

2653
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:43,980
paying

2654
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,400
attention

2655
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:44,580
what's

2656
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:44,820
going

2657
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,060
on

2658
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,630
inside

2659
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:45,990
you

2660
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:46,560
what

2661
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:46,650
you

2662
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,010
feel

2663
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:47,700
internally

2664
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:47,850
and

2665
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,300
extra

2667
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,170
paying

2668
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,590
attention

2669
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,650
to

2670
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:49,830
what's

2671
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,040
going

2672
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,370

2673
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,030
outside

2674
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,270
you

2675
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,780
hold

2676
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,960
that

2677
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,080
in

2678
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,380
mind

2679
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,740
please

2680
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,190
because

2681
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,610
the

2682
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,970
fact

2683
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,090
that

2684
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,330
you're

2685
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:54,600
both

2686
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,710
intercepting

2687
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,070
and

2688
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:56,610
extra

2691
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:57,810
true

2692
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:57,960
for

2693
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,080
your

2694
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,500
entire

2695
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:58,890
life

2696
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,070
and

2697
00:14:59,070 --> 00:14:59,190
it

2698
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,640
sets

2699
00:14:59,640 --> 00:14:59,790
the

2700
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,000
tone

2701
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,600
foundation

2702
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:00,720
for

2703
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,440
understanding

2704
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,160
emotions,

2705
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:02,400
it's

2706
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,910
absolutely

2707
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,480
critical.

2708
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:04,920
As an

2709
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,520
infant,

2710
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,840
you

2711
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,170
didn't

2712
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,380
have

2713
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,560
any

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,160

2715
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,280
of

2716
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,460
what

2717
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:08,580
you

2718
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,120
needed,

2719
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,420
you

2720
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:09,690
didn't

2721
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,290
understand

2722
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,740
hunger,

2723
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:10,890
you

2724
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,100
didn't

2725
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,670
understand

2726
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,180
toys,

2727
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,300
when

2728
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,360
you

2729
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,600
first

2730
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:12,780
came

2731
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:12,900
into

2732
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:12,990
the

2733
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,260
world,

2734
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,410
you

2735
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,680
didn't

2736
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,220
understand

2737
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,610
cold

2738
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:14,700
or

2739
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,000
heat

2740
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,150
or

2741
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,330
any

2742
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:15,450
of

2743
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:15,720
that.

2744
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:16,770
When

2745
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:16,950
you

2746
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,340
needed

2747
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,970
something,

2748
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,510
you

2749
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,320
experienced

2750
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,650
that

2751
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:19,890
as

2752
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,640
anxiety,

2753
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,360
you

2754
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,510
would

2755
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:21,960
feel

2756
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,140
an

2757
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,500
increase

2758
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:22,620
in

2759
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,130
alertness.

2760
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,280
If

2761
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,430
you

2762
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,730
had

2763
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,120
to

2764
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:24,480
use

2765
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:24,570
the

2766
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,170
bathroom,

2767
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,560
you

2768
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:25,680
would

2769
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,100
feel

2770
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:26,250
an

2771
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:26,640
increase

2772
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:26,760
in

2773
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,270
alertness,

2774
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,450
if

2775
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:27,570
you

2776
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:27,690
were

2777
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,290
hungry,

2778
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:28,980
and

2779
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,100
you

2780
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,250
would

2781
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,910
vocalize,

2782
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,060
you

2783
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,210
would

2784
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,720
cry

2785
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,170
out,

2786
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:31,710
you

2787
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:31,980
would

2788
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:32,610
act

2789
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,390
agitated,

2790
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:33,600
you

2791
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,930
might

2792
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,320
COO,

2793
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,470
you

2794
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,650
might

2795
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:34,830
do a

2796
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,160
number

2797
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,250
of

2798
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,520
different

2799
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,880
things.

2800
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,090
But

2801
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,330
all

2802
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:36,510
you

2803
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:36,990
knew

2804
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:37,410
was

2805
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:37,560
what

2806
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:37,650
you

2807
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:37,770
were

2808
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,190
fear

2809
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,730
feeling

2810
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,540
internally,

2811
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,080
and

2812
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,260
then

2813
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,440
your

2814
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,070
caregiver,

2815
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,430
whoever

2816
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,640
that

2817
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:41,850
might

2818
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:41,940
have

2819
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,300
been,

2820
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:42,630
would

2821
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:43,110
respond

2822
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,200
to

2823
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,470
that.

2824
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,740
So

2825
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:43,860
you

2826
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:43,980
would

2827
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,220
feel

2828
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,400
some

2829
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,180
agitation,

2830
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,420
a

2831
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:45,960
caregiver

2832
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,080
would

2833
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,290
come

2834
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:46,380
and

2835
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:46,530
make

2836
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:46,560
a

2837
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,190
decision,

2838
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,580
oh,

2839
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,850
you

2840
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,060
need

2841
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,450
food

2842
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:48,600
and

2843
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:48,810
give

2844
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,140
you

2845
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:49,920
milk,

2846
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,550
or

2847
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,180
change

2848
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,300
your

2849
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,810
diaper,

2850
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,380
or

2851
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,770
wrap

2852
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,070
you

2853
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,280
in a

2854
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,730
blanket

2855
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:53,820
if

2856
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:53,940
you

2857
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,060
were

2858
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,570
cold.

2859
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:55,170
But

2860
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:55,260
they

2861
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:55,440
didn't

2862
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,650
know

2863
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:55,740
if

2864
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:55,830
you

2865
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:55,950
were

2866
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,400
cold,

2867
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,730
they

2868
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:56,910
could

2869
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,120
just

2870
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,630
assume

2871
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:57,750
that

2872
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:57,870
you

2873
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,020
were

2874
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,470
cold.

2875
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:58,800
So

2876
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:58,950
this

2877
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,010
is

2878
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,430
actually

2879
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,850
really

2880
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,150
important

2881
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,210
to

2882
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,750
understand

2883
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:00,900
that

2884
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:00,960
a

2885
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,620
baby

2886
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,430
when

2887
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:02,640
you

2888
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:02,820
were

2889
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:02,880
a

2890
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,210
baby.

2891
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,300
And

2892
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,450
when

2893
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:03,720
I was

2894
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:03,750
a

2895
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,020
baby,

2896
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,260
we

2897
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:04,440
didn't

2898
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:04,680
have

2899
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,010
any

2900
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:05,550
sense

2901
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:05,700
of

2902
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:05,790
the

2903
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,240
outside

2904
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,570
world,

2905
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:06,930
except

2906
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,020
that

2907
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,110
it

2908
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,010
responded

2909
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:08,820
to

2910
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,210
our

2911
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,630
acts

2912
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:09,900
of

2913
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,710
anxiety,

2914
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,520
essentially.

2915
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,850
Now,

2916
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,060
this

2917
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,330
isn't

2918
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:12,840
Freudian

2919
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,200
theory,

2920
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,470
right?

2921
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,650
It's

2922
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:13,920
it.

2923
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,250
There

2924
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:14,280
are

2925
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,760
components

2926
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,000
of it

2927
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,150
that

2928
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,300
are

2929
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,690
embedded

2930
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:15,780
in

2931
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,200
Freudian

2932
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,500
theory.

2933
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:16,770
But

2934
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,670
all

2935
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,180
developmental

2936
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,750
psychologists

2937
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,110
agree

2938
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,260
that

2939
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,710
babies

2940
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,220
lack

2941
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,370
the

2942
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:20,940
ability

2943
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,300
to

2944
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,570
make

2945
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,110
cognitive

2946
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,350
sense

2947
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,440
of

2948
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:22,530
the

2949
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:22,920
outside

2950
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,370
world.

2951
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:23,970
But

2952
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,330
in

2953
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,690
this

2954
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,410
feeling

2955
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:25,530
of

2956
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,220
anxiety,

2957
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:26,370
and

2958
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,000
registering

2959
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,240
one's

2960
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,420
own

2961
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:27,870
internal

2962
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,290
state,

2963
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,470
and

2964
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,620
then

2965
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,130
crying

2966
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,340
out

2967
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,430
to

2968
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,550
the

2969
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,970
outside

2970
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,330
world,

2971
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,630
either

2972
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:30,840
through

2973
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,410
crying

2974
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:31,710
or

2975
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:32,220
subtle

2976
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,390
vocalizations,

2977
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:33,930
or

2978
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:34,140
even

2979
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,380
just

2980
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,830
queueing

2981
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,130
making

2982
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,310
some

2983
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,850
noise,

2984
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,480
we

2985
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,780
start

2986
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:36,870
to

2987
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,290
develop

2988
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,410
a

2989
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,190
relationship

2990
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:38,340
with

2991
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,430
the

2992
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:38,880
outside

2993
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,330
world

2994
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:39,480
in

2995
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,720
which

2996
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:39,930
our

2997
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,500
internal

2998
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,070
states,

2999
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,280
our

3000
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,700
shifts

3001
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:41,850
and

3002
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,600
anxiety,

3003
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,320
start

3004
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,440
to

3005
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:43,890
drive

3006
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,850
requests.

3007
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,180
And

3008
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:45,570
people

3009
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:45,870
come

3010
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,050
and

3011
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,590
respond

3012
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,680
to

3013
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,920
those

3014
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,640
requests,

3015
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,480
hopefully.

3016
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:49,230
And

3017
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:49,800
the

3018
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,010
reason

3019
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:50,250
I say

3020
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,730
hopefully,

3021
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:50,850
is

3022
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,000
that

3023
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,210
we've

3024
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,420
all

3025
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,840
heard,

3026
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:52,890
presumably

3027
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,130
about

3028
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,340
these

3029
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,760
cases

3030
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:53,880
of

3031
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,570
neglect.

3032
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:54,900
There

3033
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:54,990
are a

3034
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,320
lot

3035
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,380
of

3036
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,830
cases

3037
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,130
where

3038
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:56,250
if

3039
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,370
you

3040
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,880
neglect

3041
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:56,910
a

3042
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,330
baby,

3043
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:57,630
you

3044
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,380
neglect

3045
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:58,470
an

3046
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,040
adolescent

3047
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,160
or a

3048
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,760
teenager,

3049
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,570
development

3050
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:00,900
doesn't

3051
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,170
go

3052
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:01,560
well.

3053
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,740
And

3054
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:01,860
we'll

3055
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,130
touch

3056
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,280
on

3057
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,490
some

3058
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:02,550
of

3059
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:02,850
those.

3060
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,060
But

3061
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,240
those

3062
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,330
are

3063
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:03,660
really

3064
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,110
extreme

3065
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,530
cases,

3066
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:04,680
they're

3067
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:04,890
sort

3068
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:04,980
of

3069
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,130
like

3070
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,280
the

3071
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,850
parallel

3072
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,510
to

3073
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,140
experiments

3074
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,290
that

3075
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:07,380
are

3076
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,650
often

3077
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:07,830
done

3078
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:07,920
in

3079
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:07,980
the

3080
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,460
laboratory

3081
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,610
with

3082
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,180
animals,

3083
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:09,480
where

3084
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:09,630
you've

3085
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:09,840
probably

3086
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:09,990
heard

3087
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,050
of

3088
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:10,200
these

3089
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,800
enriched

3090
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,430
environments

3091
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,580
where

3092
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:11,730
they

3093
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:11,820
will

3094
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,180
give

3095
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,660
mice

3096
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:12,690
a

3097
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:12,930
bunch

3098
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,020
of

3099
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,620
toys,

3100
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:13,710
and

3101
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:13,860
they'll

3102
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,040
give

3103
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,280
them

3104
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,420
some

3105
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:15,840
different

3106
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,260
foods

3107
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,470
every

3108
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:16,710
once

3109
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,830
in a

3110
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,040
while,

3111
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:17,130
and

3112
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,280
they'll

3113
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,580
house

3114
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:17,730
them

3115
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,060
together

3116
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,180
with

3117
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,390
other

3118
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,750
mice.

3119
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:19,230
And

3120
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,380
what

3121
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:19,470
you

3122
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:19,770
find

3123
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:19,860
is

3124
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:19,980
that

3125
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,100
the

3126
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,700
animals,

3127
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:21,360
they

3128
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:21,510
will

3129
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,750
say,

3130
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,960
Oh,

3131
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,080
you

3132
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,230
know,

3133
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,440
their

3134
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,770
brain

3135
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:22,920
is

3136
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,340
thicker,

3137
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:23,460
and

3138
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:23,640
their

3139
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,240
neurons

3140
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,480
have

3141
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:24,930
more

3142
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,530
branches

3143
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:25,650
to

3144
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:25,800
them

3145
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:25,890
and

3146
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,010
all

3147
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,310
that.

3148
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:26,610
But

3149
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:26,910
that's

3150
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,450
really

3151
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,990
comparing

3152
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,950
deprivation

3153
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,280
with

3154
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,000
normalcy.

3155
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,720
What

3156
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:30,870
we

3157
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,050
want

3158
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,110
to

3159
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,410
center

3160
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:31,530
on

3161
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:31,860
today

3162
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,580
instead,

3163
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,540
is

3164
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,930
what

3165
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,440
happens

3166
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,710
when

3167
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,980
things

3168
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,190
go

3169
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,610
well,

3170
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,630
and

3171
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,380
why

3172
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,010
things

3173
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,220
might

3174
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,460
not

3175
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,610
go

3176
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:38,790
well,

3177
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:38,880
in

3178
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,120
certain

3179
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,960
circumstances

3180
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,020
is

3181
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,590
interesting,

3182
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:40,800
but

3183
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,160
to me

3184
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,430
not

3185
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,520
as

3186
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,000
interesting

3187
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,120
as

3188
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,390
what

3189
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,780
healthy

3190
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,230
emotional

3191
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,650
development

3192
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:43,950
looks

3193
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,220
like.

3194
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,340
And

3195
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,430
if

3196
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,490
you

3197
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:44,790
haven't

3198
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,240
achieved

3199
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,480
healthy

3200
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,840
emotional

3201
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,290
development,

3202
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:46,650
what

3203
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:46,800
can

3204
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:46,890
be

3205
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:47,190
done

3206
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,520
as an

3207
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,660
intervention

3208
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:48,960
at

3209
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,320
later

3210
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,620
times

3211
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:49,710
in

3212
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,950
order

3213
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,100
to

3214
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,580
rescue

3215
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:50,880
that.

3216
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,480
So

3217
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,630
the

3218
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,380
baby,

3219
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,280
you

3220
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,550
as a

3221
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,030
baby,

3222
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,750
you're

3223
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,440
flopping

3224
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:55,800
around

3225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:55,950
there

3226
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,070
in

3227
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,190
your

3228
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,670
crib,

3229
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:56,940
you're

3230
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,330
getting

3231
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:57,750
care

3232
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,960
where

3233
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,200
you

3234
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,500
where

3235
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:58,620
you

3236
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:58,860
need

3237
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,010
it

3238
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,130
and

3239
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,280
when

3240
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,400
you

3241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:17:59,610
need

3242
00:17:59,610 --> 00:17:59,760
it,

3243
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,480
presumably.

3244
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,500
And

3245
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:01,890
this

3246
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,160
gets

3247
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,580
to

3248
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:02,910
the

3249
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,720
basis

3250
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,500
of

3251
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,220
what

3252
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,910
emotions

3253
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,000
are

3254
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,450
about

3255
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,660
which

3256
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,650
emotions

3257
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:07,740
are

3258
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,040
really

3259
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,490
about

3260
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,090
forming

3261
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,810
bonds,

3262
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,440
and

3263
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,620
being

3264
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,830
able

3265
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:10,920
to

3266
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,520
predict

3267
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,880
things

3268
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,000
in

3269
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,090
the

3270
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,540
world.

3271
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,560
That's

3272
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:13,830
really

3273
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,980
what

3274
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,490
emotions

3275
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:14,610
are

3276
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,090
about

3277
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:15,900
whether

3278
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:15,960
or

3279
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,230
not

3280
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,320
the

3281
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:16,620
baby

3282
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:16,950
feels

3283
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,370
angry,

3284
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:17,490
or

3285
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:17,790
happy

3286
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:17,880
or

3287
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,150
sad.

3288
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,450
We

3289
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:18,810
don't

3290
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,200
know,

3291
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,410
we

3292
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:19,620
can

3293
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,980
guess.

3294
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,100
But

3295
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,250
we

3296
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:20,430
don't

3297
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,580
know.

3298
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:20,670
In

3299
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:20,850
fact,

3300
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,000
most

3301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,060
of

3302
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,120
the

3303
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,300
time,

3304
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,390
we

3305
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,540
don't

3306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:21,690
even

3307
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:21,810
know

3308
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:21,990
how

3309
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,170
we

3310
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:22,620
feel,

3311
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:22,860
let

3312
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,070
alone

3313
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,250
how

3314
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,460
other

3315
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,760
people

3316
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,000
feel.

3317
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,120
And

3318
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,300
that's

3319
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,420
true

3320
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:24,600
for

3321
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,170
adults.

3322
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,950
So if

3323
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,040
I

3324
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,250
asked

3325
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,310
you

3326
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,460
how

3327
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:26,580
you

3328
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,880
feel

3329
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,150
right

3330
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,780
now,

3331
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,380
I

3332
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:28,560
don't

3333
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:28,710
know

3334
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,830
that

3335
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:28,950
you

3336
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,100
could

3337
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,370
tell

3338
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:29,820
me in

3339
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,000
any

3340
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,240
kind

3341
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:30,450
of

3342
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,960
rich

3343
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,470
language

3344
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,620
that

3345
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:31,890
would

3346
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,100
i

3347
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,250
would

3348
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,460
say,

3349
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,700
Oh, I

3350
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,210
really

3351
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:33,990
understand.

3352
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,230
If

3353
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,320
you

3354
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,500
said

3355
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:34,620
you

3356
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:34,890
were

3357
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,370
very,

3358
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:35,580
very

3359
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,060
depressed

3360
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,120
or

3361
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,360
very,

3362
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,630
very

3363
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,020
happy.

3364
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,170
I'd

3365
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:37,320
have

3366
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,560
some

3367
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:37,890
sense

3368
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,160
because

3369
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,370
of

3370
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:38,910
how

3371
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,360
extreme

3372
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,540
that

3373
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:39,690
is.

3374
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:39,930
But I

3375
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,140
don't

3376
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,320
know

3377
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,470
that

3378
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,560
I

3379
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:40,740
would

3380
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:40,950
really

3381
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,160
know.

3382
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,340
And I

3383
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:41,490
don't

3384
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:41,640
think

3385
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:41,760
you

3386
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:41,910
know

3387
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,240
how I

3388
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,480
feel

3389
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,690
right

3390
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:42,900
now

3391
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,230
either.

3392
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,290
I

3393
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,440
could

3394
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,620
be

3395
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,250
furious

3396
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,460
right

3397
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:44,790
now.

3398
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,090
Or I

3399
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,240
could

3400
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,330
be

3401
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:45,510
very

3402
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:45,840
happy,

3403
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:45,930
you

3404
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,110
don't

3405
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,260
have

3406
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,470
any

3407
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,010
idea.

3408
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,340
Of

3409
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:47,550
course,

3410
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:47,670
we

3411
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:47,790
have

3412
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:47,910
these

3413
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,150
things

3414
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,360
called

3415
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,260
expressions,

3416
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:49,680
our

3417
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,100
pupils

3418
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,550
dilate

3419
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:50,670
their

3420
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,060
various

3421
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,570
cues

3422
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:51,660
of

3423
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:51,840
how

3424
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,110
people

3425
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,560
feel

3426
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:52,770
we're

3427
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:52,890
going

3428
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:52,950
to

3429
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,160

3430
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,340
about

00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,520
those

3432
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:53,910
cues.

3433
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,180
But

3434
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,240
you

3435
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,510
really

3436
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:54,750
don't

3437
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,080
know.

3438
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:55,770
And

3439
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,980

00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,370
point,

3442
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:56,430
I

3443
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,670
actually

3444
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:56,850
just

3445
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,030
want

3446
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,090
to

3447
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,630
pause

3448
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:57,750
and

3449
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,080
mention

3450
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,140
a

3451
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,560
really

3452
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,550
interesting

3453
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,210
tool

3454
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:00,990
that

3455
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,200
is

3456
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,500
trying

3457
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:01,590

3459
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,190
this

3460
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,640
question

3461
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:02,760
of

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,180
are

3464
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:03,810
emotions?

3465
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:03,930
And

3466
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,110
what

3467
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,170
do

3468
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,290
they

3469
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:04,770
consist

3470
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,010

3472
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:05,700

3473
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,880
can

3474
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,210
use,

3475
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,330
if

3476
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:06,420
you

3477
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:06,780
like,

3478
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,050
this

3479
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,290
is an

3480
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:07,590
app,

3481
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,650
I

3482
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:07,860
didn't

3483
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,220
develop

3484
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,400
it. I

3485
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,610
don't

3486
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:08,700

them.

3491
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,290
But

3492
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:10,560
the

3495
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,460
developed

3496
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,610
by

3506
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,560
research

3507
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:16,860
and

3508
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:16,980
it's

3509
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,220

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,240
it's

3514
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,510
actually

3515
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:18,840
quite

3516
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,440
interesting.

3517
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,590
I

3518
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,040
think

3519
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,340
it's

3520
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:20,640
either

3523
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,360
it's

3524
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,900
99

3525
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,290
cents,

3526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,680
again,

3527
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,040
no

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,150
them.

3532
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,450
But

3533
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,170
what

3534
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:25,290
they're

3535
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,590
trying

3537
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,130

subtlety

3543
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:29,730
on

3544
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,030

00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:36,570
in

3566
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:36,630
the

3567
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,110
future.

3568
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,230
And

3569
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,320
it's

3570
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,530
actually

3571
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:37,740
quite

3572
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,250
interesting.

3573
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,700
I'm

3574
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:38,820
on

3575
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:38,910
the

3576
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,180
app

3577
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:39,330
right

3578
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:39,570
now.

3579
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:39,690
And I

3580
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:39,810
know

3581
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:39,930
you

3582
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,170
can't

3583
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:40,350
see

3584
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,590
this,

3585
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:40,860
but

3586
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:41,430
it's

3587
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,640
called

3588
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,000

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,630
meter.

3590
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,380
And

3591
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:43,830
you

3592
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,950
can

3593
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,190
find

3594
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,430

Apple

3596
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:44,880

Android

3598
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:45,870
and

3599
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,020
you

3600
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,200
go

3601
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,440
into

3602
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,530
it

3603
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:46,680
and

3604
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:46,920
as

3605
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,250
you

3606
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,640
know,

3607
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:47,730
it

3608
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:47,970
says

3609
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,090

3610
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,300
me,

3611
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:48,660
hi,

3612
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,080
Andrew,

3613
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,320
how

3614
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,500
are

3615
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,620
you

3616
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:49,860
right

3617
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,280
now

3618
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,790
and I

3619
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,030
click

3620
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,090
the

3621
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:51,450
little

3622
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:51,870
tab

3623
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:51,960
that

3624
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,200
says

3625
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:52,470
I

3626
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,040
feel

3627
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,060
and I

3628
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,240
can

3629
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,510
either

3630
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:54,930
pick,

3631
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:55,680
high

3632
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,340
energy

3633
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:56,550
and

3634
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,390
unpleasant

3635
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,930
high

3636
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,470
energy

3637
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,680
and

3638
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,310
pleasant

3639
00:19:59,700 --> 00:19:59,970
low

3640
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,690
Energy

3641
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,440
unpleasant

3642
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:01,680
or

3643
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:01,980
low

3644
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,430
energy

3645
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:02,850
pleasant.

3646
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:03,060
And I

3647
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,180
would

3648
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,390
say

3649
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:03,600
right

3650
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:03,930
now,

3651
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,230
I

3652
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,500
feel

3653
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:04,860
high

3654
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,340
energy

3655
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:05,790
pleasant.

3656
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:05,940
So I

3657
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,150
just

3658
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,480
revealed

3659
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:06,570
to

3660
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:06,660
you

3661
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:06,900
how I

3662
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,260
feel.

3663
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:07,560
So I

3664
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,860
click

3665
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,010
on

3666
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:08,400
that.

3667
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:08,970
And

3668
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,270
then

3669
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:09,450
it

3670
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:09,660
gives

3671
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,320
you a

3672
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,950
gallery

3673
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:11,040

00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,520
colors,

3675
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:11,640
and

3676
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:11,700
you

3677
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:11,910
just

3678
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,090
move

3679
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:12,240
your

3680
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,630
finger

3681
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,750
to

3682
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:12,840
the

3683
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,560
location

3684
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,250
where

3685
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,640
you

3686
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,000
think

3687
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,090
it

3688
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,510
matches

3689
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:15,840
most.

3690
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:15,960
And

3691
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,050
as

3692
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,140
you

3693
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,260
do

3694
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,410
that

3695
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:16,800
little

3696
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,220
words

3697
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,520
pop

3698
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,090
up. I

3699
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,210
know

3700
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,360
some

3701
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:18,540
people

3702
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:18,630
are

3703
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:18,870
looking

3704
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,930

3705
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:19,080
this

3706
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,230
on

3707
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,530
Ott

3708
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,710
or

3709
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,010
listening

3710
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,070
to

3711
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,190
this

3712
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:20,340

3713
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,670
audio

3714
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:20,940
only.

3715
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,090
So

3716
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,240
stay

3717
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,930
motivated,

3718
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,440
cheerful

3719
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,950
inspired,

3720
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,040
I

3721
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,160
would

3722
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,370
say

3723
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:23,550
I'm

3724
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:23,790
feeling

3725
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,000
right

3726
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,210
now

3727
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,780
cheerful.

3728
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,170
So

3729
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,320
you

3730
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:25,650
click

3731
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,070
that.

3732
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:26,550
And

3733
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:26,700
then

3734
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:26,790
you

3735
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:26,970
just

3736
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:27,180
go to

3737
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,270
the

3738
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,480
next

3739
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:27,750
window,

3740
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,840
and

3741
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:27,930
it

3742
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,080
just

3743
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,200
says,

3744
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,350
What

3745
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,380
are

3746
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:28,500
you

3747
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,950
doing,

3748
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,070
and

3749
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,220
I,

3750
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:29,670
this

3751
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,240
feels

3752
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,420
like

3753
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,630
play

3754
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,720

3755
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:30,900
me,

3756
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,080
but

3757
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm

3758
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,260
going

3759
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,320
to

3760
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,500
call

3761
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:31,590

3762
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,040
work.

3763
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,460
And

3764
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:32,610
then

3765
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:32,850
that's

3766
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,060
it.

3767
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:33,720
And

3768
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,110
then

3769
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,040
what

3770
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,130
it

3771
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,520
does

3772
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:35,910

bit,

3981
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,180
but

3982
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,300
let's

3983
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,390
say

3984
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:51,510
you're

3985
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,840
very

3986
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,470
drowsy,

3987
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,620
you

3988
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:52,860
might

3989
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,130
be at

3990
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:53,670
a one

3991
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:53,910
or a

3992
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:54,390
two.

3993
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,440
So

3994
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,040
you

3995
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,370
always

3996
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:56,550
have

3997
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:56,640
to

3998
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,090
ask,

3999
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,450
Where

4000
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:57,480
are

4001
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:57,630
you

4002
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:57,780
on

4003
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:57,870
the

4004
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,470
arousal

4005
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:58,950
scale?

4006
00:21:59,400 --> 00:21:59,640
And

4007
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,060
then

4008
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:00,630
there's

4009
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,990
this

4010
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:01,770
other

4011
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,460
axis

4012
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,640
this

4013
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:02,880
other

4014
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,690
question,

4015
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:04,650
which

4016
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:04,830
is

4017
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,040
what

4018
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,160
we

4019
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,430
call

4020
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,210
Valence.

4021
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,450
Now

4022
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:06,930
valence

4023
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,170
is of

4024
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,740
value,

4025
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:07,890
do

4026
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:07,980
you

4027
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,250
feel

4028
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,730
good

4029
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:08,970
or

4030
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,330
bad,

4031
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:09,390
I

4032
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:09,540
would

4033
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:09,750
say I

4034
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,960
feel

4035
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,170
pretty

4036
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,350
good

4037
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:10,500
right

4038
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:10,650
now

4039
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,770
on a

4040
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,070
scale

4041
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,130
of

4042
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:11,280
one

4043
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,370
to

4044
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:11,760
10.

4045
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,060
I'm

4046
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,240
like,

4047
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:12,780
I

4048
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:12,900
don't

4049
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,020
know,

4050
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,080
I

4051
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:13,260
feel

4052
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,380
like

4053
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:13,440

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:13,950
seven.

4055
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,610
got

4056
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:14,730

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:16,890
had a

4062
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,040
good

4063
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,340
walk

4064
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,430
with

4065
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,910
Costello

4066
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,060
this

4067
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,600
morning,

4068
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,290
bed,

4069
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,470
I'm

4070
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,160
hydrated,

4071
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:20,430
I

4072
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:20,640
feel

4073
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:20,820
good

4074
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,090
something

4075
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,180
a

4076
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,690
seven.

4077
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,020
So

4078
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,140
I'm

4079
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,710
alert.

4080
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,400
And I

4081
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,580
feel

4082
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,850
pretty

4083
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,180
good.

4084
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:25,380
And

4085
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,530
then

4086
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:25,710
there's

4087
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:25,770
a

4088
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,220
third

4089
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,490
thing,

4090
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:26,730
which

4091
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:26,910
is

4092
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,420
how

4093
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:27,870
much

4094
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,170
we

4095
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:28,560
are

4096
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,000
intercepting

4097
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,210
and

4098
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:30,360
how

4099
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,540
much

4100
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:30,690
we

4101
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:30,840
are

4102
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,200
ex

4103
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,440
terror

4104
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:31,950
receptive.

4105
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,520
Alright,

4106
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:32,670
so

4107
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:32,850
how

4108
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,090
much

4109
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:33,300
our

4110
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,720
attention

4111
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:33,840
is

4112
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,260
focused

4113
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,250
internally,

4114
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,060
on

4115
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,180
what

4116
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,330
we're

4117
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:36,900
feeling

4118
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,080
and

4119
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,230
how

4120
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,440
much

4121
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:37,560
it's

4122
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,160
focused

4123
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,030
externally.

4124
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:39,780
And

4125
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,050
this

4126
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,260
is

4127
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:40,710
always

4128
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,920
going

4129
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,130
to be

4130
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,280
in a

4131
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,850
dynamic

4132
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,450
balance.

4133
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,350
So

4134
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,590
for

4135
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,890
instance,

4136
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:43,980
if

4137
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,160
you're

4138
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,640
really,

4139
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,910
really

4140
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,750
stressed,

4141
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,950
oftentimes,

4142
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,280
that

4143
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,460
puts

4144
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:47,550
you

4145
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:47,670
in a

4146
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,090
position

4147
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:48,270
to be

4148
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:48,720
really

4149
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:48,810
in

4150
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,020
touch

4151
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,170
with

4152
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:49,380
what's

4153
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,560
going

4154
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:49,830
on in

4155
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:49,950
your

4156
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,250
body.

4157
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,340
If

4158
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,430
you

4159
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:50,670
start

4160
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:50,880
having

4161
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,300
a lot

4162
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:51,390
of

4163
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,080
somatic

4164
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,320
a lot

4165
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:52,380
of

4166
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:52,800
bodily

4167
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,460
sensations,

4168
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,580
like

4169
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:53,700
your

4170
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,000
heart

4171
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,090
is

4172
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,390
beating

4173
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,750
so

4174
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,080
fast

4175
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,170
that

4176
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,290
you

4177
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:55,530
can't

4178
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:55,920
ignore

4179
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,100
it,

4180
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:56,940
then

4181
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,420
you're

4182
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:57,870
really

4183
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,350
strongly

4184
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,190
interoceptive.

4185
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,640
But

4186
00:22:59,640 --> 00:22:59,910
also,

4187
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,270
sometimes

4188
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,360
you're

4189
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,570
really

4190
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,020
stressed

4191
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,260
because

4192
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,560
someone

4193
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:01,950
stressing

4194
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,070
you

4195
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,310
out,

4196
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,400
or

4197
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,760
somebody

4198
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:02,970
sends

4199
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,120
you a

4200
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,420

4202
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,140
or

4203
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,590
makes

4204
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:04,650
a

4205
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,160
comment

4206
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,610
about

4207
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:05,700
a

4208
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,240
YouTube

4209
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,420
thing

4210
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,540
you

4211
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,020
posted

4212
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,110
or

4213
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,650
something

4214
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:07,890
and

4215
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,040
you're

4216
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,460
really

4217
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:08,850
triggered

4218
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:08,970
by

4219
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,060
it,

4220
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,180
that

4221
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,390
never

4222
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:09,780
happens

4223
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:09,840
to

4224
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:09,990
me.

4225
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,320
But

4226
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,160
it if

4227
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,280
it

4228
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,580
does

4229
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:11,940
happen

4230
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,060
to

4231
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,420
you,

4232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,020
then

4233
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:13,320
you're

4234
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,800
extra

4235
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,310
receptive.

4236
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,550
So

4237
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:14,820
these

4238
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,060
three

4239
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,420
things

4240
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:15,630
how

4241
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:15,960
alert

4242
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,140
or

4243
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,530
sleepy

4244
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:16,800
you

4245
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,190
are,

4246
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,460
that's

4247
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:17,880
one,

4248
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,570
how

4249
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:18,900
good

4250
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,050
or

4251
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,350
bad

4252
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,470
you

4253
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:19,800
feel

4254
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,100
that's

4255
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,490
too.

4256
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:20,790
And

4257
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:20,970
then

4258
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,150
whether

4259
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,180
or

4260
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,360
not

4261
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:21,630
most

4262
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:21,720
of

4263
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:21,870
your

4264
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,260
attention

4265
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:22,380
is

4266
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,800
directed

4267
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,370
outward,

4268
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:23,640
or

4269
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:23,850
whether

4270
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:23,880
or

4271
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,030
not

4272
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,120
it's

4273
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:24,570
directed

4274
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,110
inward.

4275
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:25,920
And

4276
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:26,460
much

4277
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:26,610
of

4278
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:26,760
what

4279
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:26,880
we

4280
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,210
call

4281
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,750
emotions

4282
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,840
are

4283
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,170
made

4284
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,470
up by

4285
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,800
those

4286
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,340
three

4287
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:29,970
things.

4288
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,480
And

4289
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,870
so

4290
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,590
let's

4291
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,100
return

4292
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,370
now

4293
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:32,520
to

4294
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,120
development.

4295
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,300
But

4296
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,600
tuck

4297
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:33,780
that

4298
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:33,960
away

4299
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,050
and

4300
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:34,200
just

4301
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,350
kind

4302
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,440
of

4303
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,710
think

4304
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,980
about

4305
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,100
it

4306
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,700
alert

4307
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,360
versus

4308
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:36,930
asleep,

4309
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:37,710
good

4310
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,220
versus

4311
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:38,730
bad,

4312
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,270
and

4313
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,750
focused

4314
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,320
internally

4315
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,440
or

4316
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:40,830
focus

4317
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,400
externally.

4318
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,820
Because

4319
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,510
when

4320
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:42,660
I

4321
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:42,990
looked

4322
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,350
at

4323
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:43,650
the

4324
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,160
whole

4325
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,280
of

4326
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,460
the,

4327
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,270
all

4328
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,360
the

4329
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,810
theories

4330
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:45,930
of

4331
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,410
emotion

4332
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:46,530
that

4333
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:46,650
were

4334
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:46,890
out

4335
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,040
there,

4336
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,160
there

4337
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,220
were

4338
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,610
a lot

4339
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:47,670
of

4340
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:47,910
different

4341
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,390
components

4342
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,480
to

4343
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,780
them.

4344
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,320
But

4345
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,410
they

4346
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:49,530
all

4347
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:49,710
seem

4348
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:49,800
to

4349
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,100
center

4350
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:50,400
back

4351
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,490
to

4352
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:50,880
these

4353
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:51,360
same

4354
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,600
three

4355
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,050
features

4356
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,290
in

4357
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:52,710
some

4358
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,130
way,

4359
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,550
or to

4360
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:53,760
some

4361
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,060
degree

4362
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,150
or

4363
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:54,540
another.

4364
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:54,720
And

4365
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:54,810
it

4366
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:54,930
can

4367
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,020
be

4368
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,290
very

4369
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:55,770
powerful

4370
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:55,860
to

4371
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,580
understand

4372
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:56,940
and

4373
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,240
look

4374
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,360
at

4375
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,510
your

4376
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,050
emotions

4377
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,470
through

4378
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:58,770
that

4379
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,400
lens.

4380
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,450
So

4381
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,260
let's

4382
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:01,590
return

4383
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:01,680
to

4384
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:01,830
the

4385
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,400
infant.

4386
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:02,790
There's

4387
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:02,880
the

4388
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,360
baby

4389
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,450
in

4390
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:03,540
the

4391
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,020
crib.

4392
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:04,740
It's

4393
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,190
mostly

4394
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,120
intercepting.

4395
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,170

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,660
babies

4428
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:18,840

to

4435
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:21,750

I

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,840
want

4443
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:24,960

very

4445
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,440
clear,

4446
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,590
it

4447
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,010

4449
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:27,000
Taro

cept,

4451
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:27,900
the

4452
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,230
baby

4453
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,770
starts

4454
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,010
to

4455
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,340
look

4456
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,520
into

4457
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:29,640
the

4458
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,030
outside

4459
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,360
world

4460
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,480
and

4461
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:30,870
start

4462
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,170
making

4463
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,040
predictions.

4464
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:32,610
It

4465
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,150
starts

4466
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,200
wondering

4467
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,500
how

4468
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,740
much

4469
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:34,860
it

4470
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,130
needs

4471
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:35,250
to

4472
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:35,970
cry

4473
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,420
or

4474
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,230
predicting.

4475
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,160
Well,

4476
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:38,700
if I

4477
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,210
cry

4478
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:39,420
like

4479
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:39,480
a

4480
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,870
little

4481
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:40,140
bit,

4482
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:40,740
then

4483
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,250
mom

4484
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,550
comes

4485
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,000
over

4486
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,600
and I

4487
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:42,990
get

4488
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:43,260
my

4489
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,680
milk.

4490
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,340
Or if

4491
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,630
I cry

4492
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:45,750
a

4493
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,290
lot,

4494
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:46,590
mom

4495
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:46,920
doesn't

4496
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,130
come

4497
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,400
over

4498
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,520
and

4499
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:47,700
give

4500
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:47,910
me

4501
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:48,180
milk.

4502
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,390
So I

4503
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,540
need

4504
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:48,630
to

4505
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,900
really

4506
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,650
scream

4507
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:49,770
at

4508
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:49,860
the

4509
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,130
top

4510
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,340
of my

4511
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,700
head.

4512
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,420
Okay,

4513
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:51,900
so

4514
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:52,650
babies

4515
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:52,800
are

4516
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,220
starting

4517
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,520
to

4518
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,420
evaluate

4519
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,840
and

4520
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,140
do

4521
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,290
all

4522
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:55,470
this

4523
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,620
but

4524
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:55,710
they're

4525
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:55,890
not

4526
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,070
doing

4527
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,160
it

4528
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,850
consciously.

4529
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,360
They're

4530
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,690
doing

4531
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,020
this

4532
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,340
strategically

4533
00:24:59,340 --> 00:24:59,460
in

4534
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,670
order

4535
00:24:59,670 --> 00:24:59,790
to

4536
00:24:59,790 --> 00:24:59,970
really

4537
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,240
Leave

4538
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,050
anxiety.

4539
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:01,950
And I

4540
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,340
won't

4541
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,390
propose

4542
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:03,540
that

4543
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:03,750
that's

4544
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,960
what

4545
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,410
we do

4546
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:04,740
into

4547
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,310
adulthood.

4548
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:05,490
But a

4549
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:05,820
lot

4550
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:05,910
of

4551
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,060
what

4552
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,720
we do

4553
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,080
in

4554
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,530
adulthood

4555
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:07,650
is

4556
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:07,800
when

4557
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:07,920
we

4558
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,190
feel

4559
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,610
something,

4560
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:08,730
we

4561
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,000
start

4562
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,870
exteroceptive.

4563
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,200
Some

4564
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,350
people

4565
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,440
are

4566
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:10,620
much

4567
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:10,890
better

4568
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,100
just

4569
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:11,400
sitting

4570
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,580
as a

4571
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,180
container,

4572
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,300
and

4573
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:12,570
just

4574
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,500
intercepting

4575
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:13,620
and

4576
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:13,860
paying

4577
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,250
attention

4578
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:14,310
to

4579
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,460
what

4580
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:14,580
they're

4581
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:14,940
feeling

4582
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,510
internally.

4583
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,170
But

4584
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,560
most

4585
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:16,830
people

4586
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,010
do a

4587
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,190
little

4588
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,370
bit

4589
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:17,580
of a

4590
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:17,970
balance

4591
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,060
of

4592
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,240
both,

4593
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,390
we

4594
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,660
start,

4595
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:18,780
we

4596
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:18,960
don't

4597
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,200
feel

4598
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,410
good.

4599
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:19,680
So we

4600
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:19,920
look

4601
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,370
for

4602
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,670
an

4603
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:20,910
item

4604
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,000
of

4605
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,240
food

4606
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,360
that

4607
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,570
might

4608
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,810
make

4609
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:21,930
us

4610
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,110
feel

4611
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,380
better.

4612
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,560
We're

4613
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,980
feeling

4614
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,520
anxious,

4615
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,120
heading

4616
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,450
into

4617
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:24,570
the

4618
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,050
dentist

4619
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,140
or

4620
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,410
something

4621
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:25,530
like

4622
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:25,680
that.

4623
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:25,920
So we

4624
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,220
text

4625
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,670
somebody,

4626
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,390
we do

4627
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,540
this

4628
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:27,870
almost

4629
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,440
reflexively,

4630
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,590
it's

4631
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:28,800
not

4632
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,100
always

4633
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,730
conscious.

4634
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,780
So

4635
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:31,890
infants

4636
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,040
do

4637
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,250
this,

4638
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,370
and

4639
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:32,460
we

4640
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,090
continue

4641
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,420
to do

4642
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:33,750
this,

4643
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,050
we

4644
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:34,350
start

4645
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,470
to

4646
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,710
now

4647
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,280
balance

4648
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,460
our

4649
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,390
interoceptive

4650
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:36,510
and

4651
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:36,960
extra

4652
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,650
receptive,

4653
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,760
focus

4654
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:39,150
are

4655
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,870
looking

4656
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,320
inward

4657
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:40,500
and

4658
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,860
looking

4659
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,460
outward.

4660
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,270
And

4661
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:42,510
as we

4662
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:42,690
do

4663
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,080
that,

4664
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,500
we're

4665
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:43,770
trying

4666
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:43,830
to

4667
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,070
figure

4668
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,310
out

4669
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,520
what

4670
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,730
gets

4671
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:44,820
our

4672
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,180
needs

4673
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,480
met.

4674
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,320
Remember,

4675
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,460
emotions

4676
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:47,640
are

4677
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:47,970
really

4678
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:48,240
there

4679
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,390
to

4680
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,750
form

4681
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,380
bonds,

4682
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:49,650
and

4683
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:49,740
to

4684
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:49,920
make

4685
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,700
predictions.

4686
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,030
And

4687
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,180
so

4688
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:51,300
our

4689
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:51,630
needs

4690
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:51,750
are

4691
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:51,900
going

4692
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,050
to be

4693
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:52,530
met

4694
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:52,860
to

4695
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,070
some

4696
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,370
degree

4697
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:53,520
or

4698
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:53,850
not.

4699
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,540
Sometimes,

4700
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,050
sadly,

4701
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:55,230
there

4702
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:55,380
is

4703
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:55,890
neglect.

4704
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,400
Sometimes

4705
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,610
people

4706
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:56,850
don't

4707
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,060
show

4708
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,180
up

4709
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,300
for

4710
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,450
us

4711
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,540
the

4712
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:57,690
way

4713
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:57,810
that

4714
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:57,960
we

4715
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,110
would

4716
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,500
like.

4717
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,220
And

4718
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,450
in

4719
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:00,930
general,

4720
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,320
our

4721
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,190
responses

4722
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:02,310
to

4723
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,730
that

4724
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,600
have

4725
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,900
to do

4726
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,050
with

4727
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,260
whether

4728
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,290
or

4729
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,560
not

4730
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:04,710
we

4731
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,070
predict

4732
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,280
whether

4733
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:05,310
or

4734
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:05,550
not

4735
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:05,730
they

4736
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,180
would

4737
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:06,600
or

4738
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:06,990
not,

4739
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,350
when

4740
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,470
we

4741
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,070
expect

4742
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,550
something,

4743
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:08,640
and

4744
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:08,730
it

4745
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:08,940
doesn't

4746
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,420
happen.

4747
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:09,600
It's

4748
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:09,900
a big

4749
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,380
letdown.

4750
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,500
That

4751
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:10,680
was

4752
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:10,770
the

4753
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,160
discussion

4754
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,370
about

4755
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:11,820
dopamine

4756
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,090
last

4757
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,630
episode.

4758
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,320
So

4759
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:13,620
the

4760
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:13,950
many

4761
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,400
theories

4762
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,520
of

4763
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,030
emotion

4764
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,150
the

4765
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,870
triune

4766
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,230
brain

4767
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:16,620
theory

4768
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:16,770
that

4769
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:16,860
you

4770
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,040
have

4771
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,100
a

4772
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,610
primitive

4773
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:17,730
and

4774
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,210
evolved

4775
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:18,450
brain,

4776
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:18,780
something

4777
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:18,960
that's

4778
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:18,990
a

4779
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,140
little

4780
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,260
bit

4781
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,380
on

4782
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:19,710
shaky

4783
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,040
ground

4784
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,190
these

4785
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:20,520
days,

4786
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,030
the

4787
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,330
idea

4788
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:21,480
that

4789
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:21,870
Darwin

4790
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,350
proposed

4791
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:22,440
that

4792
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,560
there

4793
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:22,590
are

4794
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:22,800
these

4795
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,370
universal

4796
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:23,940
expressions

4797
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,030
of

4798
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,660
emotions,

4799
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,590
the

4800

work

4801
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,220
of

Helen

Fisher

4804

love

4806
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:27,930
that

00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,080
you

4808
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,470
have

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:28,980

you

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,140
started

4925
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:09,480
of

4926
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,140
predicting

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,350
what

4928
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,530
would

4929
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:10,950
bring

4930
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,340
you

4931
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,480
relief,

4932
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,630
what

4933
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,750
would

4934
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,230
remove

4935
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,410
your

4936
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,130
anxiety.

4937
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,340
And

4938
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,610
that's

4939
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:14,850
where

4940
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,000
the

4941
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,630
fundamental

4942
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,320
rules

4943
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,500
of

4944
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:16,650
your

00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,140
down.

4952
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:19,710
I

4953
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,100
realized

4954
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:20,340
that's

4955
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:20,940
a lot

4956
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,300

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,110
information.

4958
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,230
And

4959
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:22,380
it's

4960
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,800
somewhat

4961
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,100
of an

4962
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:23,760

talk.

4964
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,750
But

4965
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,110
there

4966
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,200

4971
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,220
that

4972
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,310
I

4973
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,490
just

4974
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:26,640

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,120
allow

5002
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,240

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,590
And

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,730
interesting.

5020
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,210
The

5021
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:39,420
other

5022
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,660
one

5023
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:39,870
is

5024
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,050
this

5025
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,320
idea

5026
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,470
that

5027
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:40,590
there

5028
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:40,650
are

5029
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:40,950
three

5030
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,490
axes

5031
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:41,640
to

5032
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,240
emotion,

5033
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:42,900
three

5034
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,650
continuum

5035
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:43,890
that

5036
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,700
interact,

5037
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,420
the

5038
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,810
level

5039
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:45,870
of

5040
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:46,200
alertness

5041
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,320
and

5042
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:46,920
calmness,

5043
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,370
how

5044
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:47,580
good

5045
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:47,670
or

5046
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:47,940
bad

5047
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,060
you

5048
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,510
feel,

5049
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:48,750
and

5050
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:48,900
whether

5051
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:48,930
or

5052
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,080
not

5053
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,170
you're

5054
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,440
mainly

5055
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,800
focused

5056
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,190
inward

5057
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,280
or

5058
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,730
outward,

5059
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,000
because

5060
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,180
those

5061
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,240
are

5062
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,390
going

5063
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:51,510
to

5064
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,140
form

5065
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,350
a

5066
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:52,890
useful

5067
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:53,610
toolkit

5068
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,090
for

5069
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,210
the

5070
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:54,750
information

5071
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:54,990
going

5072
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,440
forward.

5073
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:55,920
So

5074
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,160
now

5075
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,400
let's

5076
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,640
talk

5077
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:56,910
about

5078
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,090
what

5079
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:57,300
kind

5080
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,420
of

5081
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:57,990
baby

5082
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,560
you

5083
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:58,920
were.

5084
00:27:59,490 --> 00:27:59,880
Because

5085
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,060
that

5086
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,360
actually

5087
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,080
informs

5088
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,380
your

5089
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,250
emotionality.

5090
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,820
Now,

5091
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,870
these

5092
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:03,990
are

5093
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,650
classic.

5094
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:04,830
They're

5095
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,040
actually

5096
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,580
famous

5097
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,270
experiments

5098
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,750
done

5099
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,110
by

5100
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,530

5107

5116
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:11,640
about

5117
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,000
this.

5118
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:13,350
This

5119
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,500
is

5120
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:13,890
this

5121
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,490
classic

5123
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,690
of

5124

the

what

5126
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,380
was

5127
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:16,560
called

5128
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:16,650
the

5129
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,070
strange

situation

5131
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,330
task,

5132
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,380
in

5133
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:19,830
which,

5134
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:20,640
and

5135
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,760
I'm

5136
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,240
describing

5137
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,330
it

5138
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:21,660
very

5139
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,140
coarsely,

5140
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,320
here,

5141
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,410
I

5142
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,920
realized

5143
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,670
but a

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,120

laboratory.

5151
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:27,900
Yes,

5152
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,080
this

bit,

5171
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,330
and

5172
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:36,480
then

5173
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,570

00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,010

And

don't

5227
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:00,960
like

5228
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,320
that.

5229
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:02,490
And

5230
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,730
there

5231
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:02,760
are

5232
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:02,910
good

5233
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:03,300
reasons

5234
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,420
for

5235
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:03,690
that

5236
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:03,870
they

5237
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,230
formed

5238
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,260
a

5239
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:04,680
bond

5240
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:04,830
and

5241
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:04,920
an

5243
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:05,550
and

5244
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:05,640
we

5245
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:05,730
will

5246
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:05,970
talk

5247
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,180
about

5248
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:06,360
some

5249
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,480
of

5250
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:06,600
the

00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,670
reasons

5254
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:08,790
for

5255
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,000
those

5256
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,570
bonds.

5257
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,490
However,

5258
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:11,640
the

5259
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,270

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,390

5261
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:12,900
focused

5262
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,290
on

5263
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,440
the

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,190
the

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,780

many

5274
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,030

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,390
four

00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,140
patterns

5285
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,410
that

5286
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,040

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,570
display

5288
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:27,960

returns.

5292
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,610
And

5293
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:29,730
they

5294
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,030
group

5295
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,300
these

C, D,

5300
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,030
so

5301
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,240
much

5302
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,660
so

5303
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,140
that

5304
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:34,740
the

5312
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,440
babies

5313
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:37,800
see

5314
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,310

5315
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,640
or D

5316
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,060
babies.

5317
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:40,470
You

5318
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,620
may

5319
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:40,800
know

5320
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,100
which

5321
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,340
one

5322
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,490
you

5323
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:41,850
were,

5324
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,480
but

5325
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:42,660
the

5326
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,140
categories

5327
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:43,230
are

5328
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,500
really

5329
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:43,980
interesting.

5330
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,130
The

5331
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:44,460
first

5332
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,000
babies

5333
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:45,390
are

5334
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:45,690
the A

5335
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,230
babies.

5336
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,680
So

5337
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:46,830
these

5338
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:46,950
were

5339
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,310
kids

5340
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,520
that

5341
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:47,640
would

5342
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:47,790
get

5343
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,120
upset

5344
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,240
when

5345
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,330
their

5346
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:48,780
caretaker

5347
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:48,900
would

5348
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,290
leave.

5349
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,070
But

5350
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,580
when

5351
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:50,820
their

5352
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,300
caretaker

5353
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,510
would

5354
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,230
return,

5355
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,190
the

5356
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,580
infant

5357
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:53,730
would

5358
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,330
respond

5359
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,720
with

5360
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,290
happiness

5361
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:55,500
with

5362
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:55,740
what

5363
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:55,890
looked

5364
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,100
like

5365
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,550
delight.

5366
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:56,790
They

5367
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:56,910
would

5368
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,210
go to

5369
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,300
the

5370
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,900
caretaker,

5371
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,020
they

5372
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,260
seemed

5373
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,830
happy

5374
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,160
if

5375
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,310
they

5376
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,430
had

5377
00:29:59,430 --> 00:29:59,580
been

5378
00:29:59,580 --> 00:29:59,970
fussy

5379
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Before

5380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,080
sad,

5381
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,410
they

5382
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,770
felt

5383
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,340
relieved.

5384
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:04,079
These

5385
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,229
are

5386
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:04,529
referred

5387
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:05,039
to as

5388
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:05,609

00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,299
attached

5390
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:06,989
kids.

5391
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:07,709
So

5392
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,129
they

5393
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:08,429
have

5394
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:08,489
a

healthy

5396
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:09,419
response

5397
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:09,509
to

5398
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:10,139
separation

5399
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:10,229
and

5400
00:30:10,229 --> 00:30:10,349
they

5401
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:10,469
have

5402
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:10,529
a

5403
00:30:10,529 --> 00:30:10,859
healthy

5404
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:11,489
response

5405
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,689
to re

5406
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:13,229
engaging

5407
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:13,379
with

5408
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:13,439
the

5409
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:14,069
caretaker.

5410
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:15,149
The B

5411
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:15,749
babies,

5412
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:15,959
as

5413
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,079
they're

5414
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:16,499
called,

5415
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:17,849
were

5416
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:19,319
less

5417
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,709
likely

5418
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:19,799
to

5419
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,069
seek

5420
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:20,459
comfort

5421
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:20,609
from

5422
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:20,759
their

5423
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,449
caregiver

5424
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:21,959
when

5425
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:22,049
the

5426
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:22,499
caregiver

5427
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:22,649
would

5428
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:23,129
return.

5429
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:23,909
So

5430
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:24,059
they

5431
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:24,329
would

5432
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:24,749
sometimes

5433
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:25,169
continue

5434
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:25,289
to

5435
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:25,439
play

5436
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:25,589
with

5437
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:25,709
their

5438
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:26,279
toys

5439
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:26,609
or

5440
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:27,029
they

5441
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,239
would

5442
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:27,779
be

5443
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:27,989
with

5444
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:28,259
the

5445
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:28,529
they

5446
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:28,799
had

5447
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:29,039
an

5448
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,339
adult

5449
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:29,429
in

5450
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:29,519
the

5451
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:29,699
room

5452
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:29,819
while

5453
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:29,909
the

5454
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:30,149
parent

5455
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:30,269
was

5456
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:30,629
gone,

5457
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:30,719
they

5458
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:30,839
would

5459
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,019
stay

5460
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:31,199
with

5461
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:31,589
them.

5462
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,099
It

5463
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:32,459
was

5464
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:33,059
sometimes

5465
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:33,749
complicated

5466
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:33,839
and

5467
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,439
nuanced,

5468
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:34,979
but

5469
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:35,249
these

5470
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:35,369
were

5471
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:35,669
referred

5472
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,059
to as

5473
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:36,719
avoidant

5474
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:37,379
babies.

5475
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:39,029
Don't

5476
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,179
run

5477
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:39,359
away

5478
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:39,509
with

5479
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:39,629
any

5480
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,169
conclusions

5481
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:40,349
about

5482
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:40,409
the

5483
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:40,799
language

5484
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,009
here

5485
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:41,309
just

5486
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:41,669
yet.

5487
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:42,869
It's

5488
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:43,079
not

5489
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,349
clear

5490
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:43,469
that

5491
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:43,889
avoidant

5492
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:44,219
babies

5493
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:44,459
become

5494
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:44,909
avoidant

5495
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,419
adults.

5496
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:46,409
but

5497
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:46,619
bear

5498
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:46,829
with

5499
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:47,039
me,

5500
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:47,609
the

5501
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:47,879
see

5502
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,479
babies

5503
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:49,949
would

5504
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:50,999
respond

5505
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:51,119
to

5506
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:51,209
the

5507
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:51,539
return

5508
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:51,629
of

5509
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:51,689
the

5510
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,409
caregiver

5511
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:53,219
with

5512
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:54,179
acts

5513
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:54,299
of

5514
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:54,899
annoyance,

5515
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:55,049
they

5516
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:55,289
seem

5517
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:55,559
kind

5518
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:55,709
of

5519
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:56,429
angry,

5520
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:56,939
right.

5521
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:57,089
So it

5522
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:57,359
wasn't

5523
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:57,479
that

5524
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:57,869
they

5525
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:58,439
ignored

5526
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:58,619
them,

5527
00:30:58,619 --> 00:30:58,739
they

5528
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:58,949
seem

5529
00:30:58,949 --> 00:30:59,129
kind

5530
00:30:59,129 --> 00:30:59,249
of

5531
00:30:59,279 --> 00:30:59,879
angry.

5532
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:00,479
And

5533
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:00,629
those

5534
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:00,749
were

5535
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:01,019
referred

5536
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:01,439
to as

5537
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,219
ambivalent

5538
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:02,819
babies.

5539
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:03,119
Not

5540
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:03,269
to be

5541
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:03,689
confused

5542
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:03,839
with

5543
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:03,959
a

5544
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:04,259
babies

5545
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:04,469
these

5546
00:31:04,469 --> 00:31:04,559
are

5547
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:04,709
the

5548
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:05,039
see

5549
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,459
babies

5550
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:05,609
were

5551
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:05,759
the

5552
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,359
ambivalent

5553
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:06,869
babies.

5554
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:07,649
So

5555
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:07,859
the

5556
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:08,219
infant's

5557
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:08,789
reaction

5558
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,909
to

5559
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,029
the

5560
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,629
returning

5561
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:10,439
caregiver

5562
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:10,829
were

5563
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:11,819
inconsistent.

5564
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:12,779
They

5565
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:13,319
seemed

5566
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:13,469
like

5567
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:13,589
they

5568
00:31:13,589 --> 00:31:14,129
wanted

5569
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:14,249
to

5570
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:14,579
bond

5571
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:14,729
with

5572
00:31:14,729 --> 00:31:14,849
them

5573
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:15,299
again,

5574
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:15,629
but

5575
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:16,079
that

5576
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:16,229
they

5577
00:31:16,229 --> 00:31:16,439
seem

5578
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:16,649
kind

5579
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:16,709
of

5580
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,339
annoyed.

5581
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:17,909
I

5582
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:18,089
think

5583
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:18,299
we've

5584
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:18,449
all

5585
00:31:18,449 --> 00:31:18,719
felt

5586
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:18,899
this

5587
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:19,049
way

5588
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:19,409
before

5589
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:19,859
with

5590
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:20,099
people

5591
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:20,219
that

5592
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:20,309
we

5593
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:20,489
care

5594
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:20,639
very

5595
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:20,849
much

5596
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:21,119
about,

5597
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:21,749
especially

5598
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,079
people

5599
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:22,229
we

5600
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:22,379
care

5601
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:22,559
very

5602
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:22,769
much

5603
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:23,099
about.

5604
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:23,729
And

5605
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:23,849
then

5606
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:23,939
the

5607
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:24,149
third

5608
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,569
category,

5609
00:31:24,569 --> 00:31:24,869
the D

5610
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:25,349
babies

5611
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:25,559
were

5612
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:25,679
the

5613
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,549
disorganized

5614
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:27,059
babies.

5615
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:27,299
That's

5616
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:27,419
what

5617
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:27,509
they

5618
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,749
call

5619
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:27,869
them.

5620
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:27,989
They

5621
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:28,169
weren't

5622
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:28,739
disorganized,

5623
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:28,829
and

5624
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:28,919
that

5625
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:29,009
they

5626
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:29,129
were

5627
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:29,639
messy.

5628
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:30,119
The

5629
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:30,539
child

5630
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:31,049
avoided

5631
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:31,769
interactions

5632
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:32,039
with

5633
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,819
everyone

5634
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:33,509
and

5635
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:33,869
acted

5636
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:34,409
fearful

5637
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:34,559
when

5638
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:34,649
the

5639
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,189
caregiver

5640
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:35,729
returned.

5641
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:36,539
And

5642
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:36,779

didn't

5645
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:37,709
really

5646
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,189
change

5647
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:38,339
whether

5648
00:31:38,339 --> 00:31:38,369
or

00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:38,519

5652
00:31:39,089 --> 00:31:39,269

5653
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:39,479
there

5654
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:39,509
or

5655
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,989
not.

5656
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:40,259
And

5657
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:40,379
that

actually

5662
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:42,089
added

5663
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:42,389
rather

00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,749

I

5672
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:44,969

5673
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,299
mention

5674
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:45,629
these

00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:51,329
There

5687
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:51,479

looking

theme.

5708
00:31:58,829 --> 00:31:59,219
But

5709
00:31:59,519 --> 00:31:59,849
over

5710
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:00,269
time,

5711
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:00,389
it

5712
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:00,569
made

5713
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:00,659
it

5714
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:01,169
clear

5715
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:01,619
that

5716
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,189
certain

5717
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:02,789
babies

5718
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:03,479
are

00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,929
able

5720
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:04,439
to

5721
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:05,159
feel

5722
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:05,879
secure

5723
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:06,389
upon

5724
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:06,689
re

5725
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:07,439
engaging

5726
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:08,009
with

5727
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,159
their

5728
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:08,759
caregiver

5729
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:08,999
and

5730
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:09,389
others

5731
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:09,899
don't,

5732
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,259
or

5733
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:10,379
they're

5734
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:10,949
confused

5735
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:11,219
about

5736
00:32:11,219 --> 00:32:11,459
it.

5737
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:13,559
So we

5738
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:14,429
probably

5739
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:14,909
don't

5740
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:15,239
know

5741
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:15,419
whether

5742
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:15,449
or

5743
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:15,599
not

5744
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:15,689
you

5745
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:15,809
were

5746
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,139
an A

5747
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:16,379
or B,

5748
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:16,799
or C,

5749
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,009
D,

5750
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:17,459
baby,

5751
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:18,179
unless

5752
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:18,269
you

5753
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:18,359
were

5754
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:18,449
in

5755
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:18,629
these

5756
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:19,229
experiments.

5757
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:19,319
And

5758
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:19,589
somehow

5759
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:19,709
you

5760
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:19,919
had

5761
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,129
that

5762
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:20,669
knowledge.

5763
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,389
But

5764
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:22,019
this

5765
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:22,439
work,

5766
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:22,619
this

5767
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:23,159
classic

5768
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:23,609
work

5769
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:24,449
opened

5770
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,409
up a

5771
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:25,799
huge

5772
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,009
set

5773
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:26,099
of

5774
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:26,489
important

5775
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:27,179
questions

5776
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:27,779
that

5777
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,109
relate

5778
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:28,439
to

5779
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:28,979
what

5780
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:29,279
is

5781
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:29,399
the

5782
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,179
reestablishment

5783
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:30,269
of

5784
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:30,329
the

5785
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:30,689
bond

5786
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,019
really

5787
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:31,529
about

5788
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:31,649
I

5789
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:31,799
mean,

5790
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,069
what's

5791
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:32,519
actually

5792
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:32,909
being

5793
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:33,689
figured

5794
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:33,929
out

5795
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:34,199
here

5796
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:34,379
is

5797
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:34,679
not

5798
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:34,859
whether

5799
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:34,889
or

5800
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:35,039
not

5801
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,159
there

5802
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:35,189
are

5803
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:35,429
four

5804
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:35,999
categories

5805
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:36,089
of

5806
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:36,479
babies.

5807
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:36,719
That's

5808
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:37,349
interesting,

5809
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:37,829
but

5810
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:38,039
it

5811
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,789
presumably

5812
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:39,209
is

5813
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:39,839
more

5814
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,349
interesting

5815
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:40,439
to

5816
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:40,829
focus

5817
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:41,159
on.

5818
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:42,299
What

5819
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:42,599
is it

5820
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:42,899
that

5821
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:43,919
defines

5822
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,009
a

5823
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:44,369
really

5824
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:44,639
good

5825
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:45,119
bond,

5826
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:45,179
a

5827
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:45,629

00:32:45,629 --> 00:32:46,349
attachment

5829
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:46,709
or an

5830
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:47,159
insecure

5831
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:47,699
attachment

5832
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:47,939
or an

5833
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:48,479
avoidant

5834
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,079
attachment.

5835
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:50,189
And

5836
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:50,789
the

5837
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:51,119
four

5838
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:51,779
things

5839
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:52,709
are

5840
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:53,489
gaze,

5841
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:55,259
literally

5844
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:56,579
and

5845
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:56,819
doesn't

5846
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:56,999
have

00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:57,449

00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,959

00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:02,969
each

5873
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:03,149
other.

5874
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:03,209
You

5875
00:33:03,209 --> 00:33:03,359
see

5876
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:03,719
couples,

5877
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:03,839
they

5878
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,019
look

5879
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:04,109
at

5880
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:04,259
each

5881
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:04,529
other,

5882
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:04,649
they

5883
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:04,829
don't

5884
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:05,099
always

5885
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:05,279
stare

5886
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,429
each

5887
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:05,639
other

5888
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:05,879
long

5889
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:06,179
periods

5890
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:06,239
of

5891
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:06,479
time,

5892
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:06,899
sometimes

5893
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:07,019
they

5894
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:07,319
do

5895
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:09,059
vocal

5896
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,139
vocalizations.

5897
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:10,709
So

5898
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,069
what

5899
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:11,219
we

5900
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:11,549
say

5901
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:11,639
and

5902
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:11,849
how

5903
00:33:11,849 --> 00:33:11,969
we

5904
00:33:11,969 --> 00:33:12,269
say

5905
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:12,509
it,

5906
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:13,469
an

5907
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:14,069
effect

5908
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:14,640
or

5909
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,180
emotion,

5910
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,330
so

5911
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:15,450
the

5912
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:15,660
way

5913
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:15,810
that

5914
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:15,930
we

5915
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,560
express,

5916
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:16,800
you

5917
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:16,890
know,

5918
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:17,640
crying,

5919
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
smiling,

5920
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,110
etc.

5921
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,070
and

5922
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,640
touch

5923
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,390
those

5924
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:21,630
four

5925
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:21,990
things.

5926
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,200
And

5927
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,350
you

5928
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,860
probably

5929
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,190
could

5930
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:23,580
add a

5931
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:23,880
fifth

5932
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,480
dimension

5933
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:24,930

5938
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,120
develops,

5939
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,510
which

5940
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:27,660

people

5962
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,710
can

00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,130
bond,

5964
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:35,640
but

00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,450
really

5972
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:39,930
the

00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,680
core

5974
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:41,160

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,340
this

5976
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,550
thing

5977
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:41,670
that

5978
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:41,820

emotionality.

5984
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:45,390
Now,

5985
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:45,600
that's

5986
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,140
important.

5987
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,350
We

5988
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,680
know

5989
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:46,890

00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,990
that

6008
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,320
is

6009
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,370
responsible

6010
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:53,490
for

6011
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:53,580
the

6012
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,120

extremely

6025
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,210
accurate

6026
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,360

6027
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,840
strong.

6028
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,830
Likewise,

6029
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,700

not

00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,580
remarkable.

6042
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:08,880
If

you're

6059
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:12,900
talking

6060
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:12,960

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,050
them

6062
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,140
and

6063
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,200
all

6064
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,290

6070
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:14,970
but

6071
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,120
you

6072
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,570
don't.

6073
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:15,900
It's

6074
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,170
as if

6075
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:16,320
they've

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,530

6081
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:18,390
of a

sudden,

6083
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:18,660
they

6084
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:18,780

And

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,310
indeed,

6092
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:20,640

6158
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:38,910
It's

6159
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,090
not

6160
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:39,270

It's

Yes,

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,420
So

6226
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:00,600
those

6249
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,110

frowns

6262
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,340

00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,450
well,

6268
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:12,750
you

6269
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:12,930
can

6270
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:13,290
read

6271
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:13,950
inflections

6272
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:14,220
in

6273
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,520
like,

6274
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,700
even

6275
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:14,880
little

6276
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,300
subtle

6277
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,690
things

6278
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:15,930
like,

6279
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,410
you

6280
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:16,560
know,

6281
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:16,680
they

6282
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:16,980
don't,

6283
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,190
they

6284
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,550
don't

6285
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:17,880
really

6286
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,240
believe

6287
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,660
me or

6288
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,020
Oh,

6289
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,350
they,

6290
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,460
they're

6291
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:20,700
really

6292
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,150
excited

6293
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:21,330
by

6294
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:21,660
this

6295
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,020
or

6296
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,370
Oh,

6297
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:23,520
you

6298
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,790
know,

6299
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,180
now I

6300
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,360
know

6301
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,480
what

6302
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,630
they're

6303
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,140
thinking,

6304
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,590
that

6305
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,010
kind

6306
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:26,250
of

6307
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,330
processing.

6308
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,660
Some

6309
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:27,900
people

6310
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,050
are

6311
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:28,830
better

6312
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,070
at it

6313
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:29,220
than

6314
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,550
others.

6315
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:29,790
But

6316
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,240
everyone's

6317
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,510
better

6318
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:30,600
at

6319
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:30,810
doing

6320
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:30,960
that

6321
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,110
with

6322
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,350
people

6323
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:31,470
that

6324
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:31,590
we

6325
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,130
recognize

6326
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,250
and

6327
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,580
know.

6328
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:32,970
In

6329
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,210
fact,

6330
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:33,690
couples

6331
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:33,900
come

6332
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:33,990
to

6333
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,140
know

6334
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,290
each

6335
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:34,500
other

6336
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,550
exceedingly

6337
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,000
well,

6338
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,480
so

6339
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:36,690
much

6340
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:36,930
so

6341
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,230
that

6342
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:37,770
it

6343
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:37,950
can

6344
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,190
both

6345
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,670
benefit

6346
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,030
and

6347
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,420
injure

6348
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,570
their

6349
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,260
relationship

6350
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:40,560
to

6351
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,160
constantly

6352
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,400
be

6353
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,700
making

6354
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:41,880
these

6355
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,570
perceptions.

6356
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:42,900
But

6357
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,050
there's

6358
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,110
a

6359
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,410
range,

6360
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:43,590
some

6361
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:43,770
people

6362
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,010
are

6363
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,310
more

6364
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,520
tuned

6365
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:44,730
into

6366
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,000
this

6367
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,210
than

6368
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,630
others.

6369
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,170
And

6370
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:46,350
that

6371
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:46,980
probably

6372
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,310
has

6373
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,850
roots

6374
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,540
in

6375
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,630
the

6376
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,900
sorts

6377
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,020
of

6378
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,530
attachments

6379
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:49,650
that

6380
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:49,740
you

6381
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,070
form

6382
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,340
early

6383
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,670
on.

6384
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,030
So

6385
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,480
Bowlby

6386
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:51,630
and

6387
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,230
colleagues

6388
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:53,400
developed

6389
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:53,580
these

6390
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,540
ABCD

6391
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,260
thing.

6392
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:55,920
And

6393
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:55,980
it

6394
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,220
has a

6395
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:56,430
lot

6396
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:56,610
to do

6397
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,730
with

6398
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:56,970
face

6399
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,690
processing,

6400
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:57,930
and

6401
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:58,470
gaze

6402
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:58,800
and

6403
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,760
vocalizations

6404
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,120
and

6405
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,540
touch

6406
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:00,870
all

6407
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,960
of

6408
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,200
those

6409
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,620
happened

6410
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:01,770
on

6411
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:02,250
return

6412
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,460
with

6413
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,520
the

6414
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,790
mother,

6415
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:02,910
but

6416
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,030
they

6417
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,330
weren't

6418
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,810
parsing

6419
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:03,960
those.

6420
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,050
They

6421
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,290
weren't

6422
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:04,500
looking

6423
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:04,590
at

6424
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:04,710
them

6425
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,340
individually.

6426
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:06,420
So

6427
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,350
this

6428
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,710
raises

6429
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:07,800
a

6430
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,070
really

6431
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,490
interesting

6432
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,030
question,

6433
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:09,660
which

6434
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:09,990
is,

6435
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,550
what

6436
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:11,970
is it

6437
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,240
when

6438
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,390
we

6439
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,750
feel

6440
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,380
something,

6441
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,280
Is it

6442
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,390
because

6443
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,480
of

6444
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,780
something

6445
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:15,870
that

6446
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,170
happened

6447
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,040
spontaneously

6448
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,160
in

6449
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,370
us,

6450
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:17,490
it's

6451
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:17,550
a

6452
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,150
memory,

6453
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,510
or

6454
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,630
it's

6455
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,900
something

6456
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:18,990
that

6457
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,110
we

6458
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,650
realized

6459
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:19,740
we

6460
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:19,920
saw

6461
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,010
on

6462
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,100
the

6463
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,520
internet,

6464
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:20,700
or we

6465
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:20,880
got

6466
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,180
news

6467
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:21,420
about

6468
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:21,990
somebody,

6469
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:22,500
you

6470
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:22,620
know,

6471
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,130
nowadays,

6472
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,370
people

6473
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:23,490
get

6474
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:23,610
so

6475
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:23,760
much

6476
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,270

6477
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,450
about

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:24,540
the

6479
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,810

6480
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:24,930
they

6481
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,410
know,

6482
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,680
but

6483
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:25,770
the

6484
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:25,980
people

6485
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,100
they

6486
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,370
like

6487
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:26,460
and

6488
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:26,940
dislike

6489
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,180
by

6490
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,630
way

6491
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,020

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,450
right,

6496
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:30,600
so

6497
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:30,750
they're

6498
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,230

6500
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:31,920
And

6501
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,040
then

6502
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,190
it's

6507
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,170
And

6508
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:34,470
it's

6509
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,070

6510
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,490

you

6560
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:55,800
would

Even

00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:01,320
if

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,440
they're

00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:04,860
they're

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,330
then

6592
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:06,420
you

00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,690
put,

6594
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:06,840
you

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,110
know,

6596
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,200
a

00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:08,610
they

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,750
well,

6606
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,050
then

6607
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,230
they're

6608
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,470
not

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,130
really

6610
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:11,730

6611
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:11,910
they

00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:12,480
they're

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,080
calm,

6615
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:13,920
insofar

6616
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,070
as

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,220
there

6618
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,460
is in

6619
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:14,730
something

6620
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,210
disturbing

6624
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,440
So

6625
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:16,590
how

6626
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:16,830
much

6627
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,010
you're

00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:18,750
disrupts

6632
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:18,870
your

6636
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,670
everything

6637
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:20,820
to do

6638
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:20,970
with

6639
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,090
this

6640
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,510
balance

6641
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,630
of

6642
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,320
interoception.

6643
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,410
And

6644
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:22,470
an

6647
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,430
and

6648
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,490
it

6649
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:23,730
very

6650
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,030
likely

6651
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,210

6652
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,720
roots

6653
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:24,900
in

6654
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,170
whether

not

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,260
insecure,

ambivalent,

6667
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,380
as a

6669
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,310
Of

6670
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,490
course,

6671
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:32,580
you

6672
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:32,760
can't

6673
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,030
travel

6674
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,240

6677
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:33,660

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,110
no,

6679
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:34,500
but

6680
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:34,650
there

6681
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:34,740

some

6683
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,430
hints

6684
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:35,790
as to

6685
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,120
what

6686
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,330
kind

6687
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:36,420
of

6688
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,320
emotionality

6689
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,560
each

6690
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:37,860
of us

6691
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,460
has,

6692
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:38,910
by

6693
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:39,780
examining

6694
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,530
two

6695
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:40,920
periods

6696
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,040
of

6697
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,580
development.

6698
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,150
One

6699
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,570
is

6700
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,200
adolescence

6701
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,290
and

6702
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,830
puberty,

6703
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,340
and

6704
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,430
the

6705
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:44,820
other

6706
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,030
is

6707
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,600
adulthood.

6708
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:45,840
So

6709
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:45,990
while

6710
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,140
we

6711
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,410
can't

6712
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:46,740

6713
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:46,980

6714
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,100

6715
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:47,640

6716
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,180
there

6717
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,420

6721
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:49,500

6722
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,940
do to

6723

6724
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:51,690

6725
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:51,990

6731
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:53,790
not

6732
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:53,910
you

6733
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:54,150
have

6734
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,210
a

interoception.

6743
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,560
Whether

6744
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:58,590
or

6745
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:58,860
not

6746
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,010
you

6747
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,370
are

6748
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,090
better,

6749
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,210

moment,

6754
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:01,770
at

6755
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:01,980
paying

6756
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,370
attention

6757
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:02,430
to

6758
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:02,640
what's

6759
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:02,880
going

6760
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,090

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,870
internally,

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,470

00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,070
externally.

6764
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:05,160
And

6765
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,250
of

6766
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:05,610
course,

00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:05,790
this

6768
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:05,910
will

6769
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,360
vary

6770
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,510
with

00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,320
circumstance.

6772
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:07,860
I

6773
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,010
think

6774
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:08,130
we

6775
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,280
all

6776
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,460
know

6777
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:08,940
people

6778
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,300
that

6779
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:09,840
maybe

6780
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:09,960
it's

6781
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,290
you,

6782
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,530
you

6783
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,190
go to

6784
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,280
a

6785
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,880
party,

6786
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,210
and

6787
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:12,330
you

6788
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:12,570
get

6789
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:12,960
there,

6790
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:13,560
and

6791
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:13,920
everyone

6792
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,130
seems

6793
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,280

6794
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,700
talking

6795
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:14,790
and

6796
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,030

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,290
And

6802
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:16,470
you're

6803
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,830
wondering

6804
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,100
whether

6805
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:17,130

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,220
something

6820
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,340
on

6821
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,460

00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:39,900
the

6892
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,290
events

6893
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:40,650
around

6894
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:40,920
you,

6895
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,760
versus

6896
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:42,420
the

6897
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:42,720
events

6898
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,230
inside

6899
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,500
you.

6900
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,220
Actually,

6901
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,310
it's

6902
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,970
interesting

6903
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:45,390
when

6904
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,510
you

6905
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:45,840
talk

6906
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:45,930
to

6907
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,230
people

6908
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,350
who

6909
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:46,440
are

6910
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,770
very

6911
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,580
effective

6912
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,380
athletes,

6913
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:49,890
or

6914
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:50,010
they

6915
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,070
have

6916
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,340
very

6917
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:50,550
high

6918
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:50,880
stress,

6919
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,000
high

6920
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,600
consequence

6921
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,110
jobs,

6922
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,500
they

6923
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:52,740
talk

6924
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:52,950
about

6925
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,070
this

6926
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,400
notion

6927
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,520
of

6928
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:53,640
you

6929
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:53,760
know,

6930
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,420
getting

6931
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:54,630
out

6932
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,720
of

6933
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:54,870
your

6934
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,170
head,

6935
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,350
you

6936
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:55,560
only

6937
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,800
have

6938
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,040
so

6939
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,250
much

6940
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,700
attentional

6941
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,300
resource.

6942
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,020
And

6943
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:58,320
it

6944
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:58,470
can

6945
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,560
be

6946
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:58,950
split

6947
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,280
between

6948
00:38:59,280 --> 00:38:59,430
two

6949
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,880
things,

6950
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:00,060
you'll

6951
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,210
see

6952
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:00,360
that

6953
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:00,480
in a

6954
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:00,840
moment,

6955
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:01,350
that

6956
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,470
can

6957
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:01,620
be

6958
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:01,980
anchored

6959
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,070
to

6960
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,280
one

6961
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,730

6962
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,030
it

6963
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,150

6964
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,240
be

6967
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:04,800
on

6968
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:04,950
what's

6969
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,130
going

6970
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:05,310

6971
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,000
internally,

6972
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,330
or it

6973
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,420
can

6974
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,540
be

on

6978
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,230
what's

6979
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:07,410
going

6980
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:07,590

6982
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,520
And

6983
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:08,790
if

6984
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,880
you

6985
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,060
want

6986
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,210
to be

6987
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:09,780

6988
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:09,900
in

6989
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:09,960
the

6990
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,350
world,

6991
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,980
effective

6992
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,160

quotes,

6995
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:12,810
it is

6996
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,470
useful

6997
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:13,980
when

6998
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:14,160
in

6999
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,520

7000
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,240
dynamic

7001
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,170
environments,

7002
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,070
especially

7003
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,460
social

7004
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,060

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,720
a lot

7008
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:18,780
of

7009
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:18,960
your

7010
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,500

7011
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,070

7012
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,820
outward,

7013
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,240
as

7014
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,570
opposed

7015
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:21,930
to

7016
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,290
try

7017
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:22,380
and

7018
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,950
do

7019
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,190
pay

7020
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,520
attention

7021
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:23,580
to

7022
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:23,730
whether

7023
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:23,760
or

7024
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:23,880
not

7025
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,000
you're

7026
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,240
saying

7027
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,540
things

7028
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,020
correctly,

7029
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,140
or

7030
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,230
the

7031
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:25,590
tambour

7032
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:25,680
of

7033
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:25,830
your

7034
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,010
own

7035
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:26,370
voice

7036
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:26,550
that

7037
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:26,850
is

7038
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,510
more

7039
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:27,540
or

7040
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,720
less

7041
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,560
destructive

7042
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,370
for

7043
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:29,850
the

7044
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,360
ability

7045
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:30,540
to

7046
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:30,930
engage

7047
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:31,530
socially.

7048
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,490
So

7049
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,180
here's

7050
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,300
the

7051
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,080
exercise.

7052
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:35,310
You

7053
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:35,460
can

7054
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:35,640
do

7055
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:35,880
this,

7056
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,090
please

7057
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,240
don't

7058
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,330
do

7059
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:36,480
this

7060
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:36,570
if

7061
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:36,690
you're

7062
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,320
driving.

7063
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:38,730
But

7064
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,120
let's

7065
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,480
just

7066
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:39,900
try

7067
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,140
and

7068
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,280
illustrate

7069
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:41,460
or

7070
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,790
allow

7071
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,360
you

7072
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:42,630
to

7073
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,350
experience

7074
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:43,500
this

7075
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,310
interoceptive

7076
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,700
extra

7077
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,120
receptive

7078
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,690
balance

7079
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,020
and

7080
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,110
the

7081
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,620
extent

7082
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:46,740
to

7083
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,130
which

7084
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:47,520
you

7085
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,730
can

7086
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,300
move

7087
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,200
interoception

7088
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,350
and

7089
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:49,650
extra

7091
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:50,910
deliberately.

7092
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:52,590
If

7093
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,010
you

7094
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,430
close

7095
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,580
your

7096
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:53,910
eyes

7097
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:54,090
right

7098
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,540

Are

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:24,840
Are

7198
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,000
beating

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:27,390
what

7201
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:27,750

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,590
of

7206
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:28,710
your

7207
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,190
breathing,

7208
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,580
basically

7209
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,030
bringing

7210
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:30,420

7211
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,110

7212
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,200
and

7213
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,770
attention

7214
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,070

7215
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,460

00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,640
the

7218
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,150
surface

7219
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,240
of

7220
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,360
your

7224
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,190
So

7225
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:35,430
I'm

7226
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,550

00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,330
rare

7230
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:36,630
thing

7231
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,720
on

7232
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:36,780

00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:37,710
podcast,

7236
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:37,770
I'm

7237
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:37,890
going

7238
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:37,950
to

7239
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,460
introduce

7240
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:38,670
about

7241
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:38,910
five

7242
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:38,970
to

7243
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,120
eight

7244
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:39,480
seconds

7245
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,570
of

7246
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,170
silence

7247
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:40,860
in

7248
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,010
order

7249
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,070
to

7250
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,310
allow

7251
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:41,430
you

7252
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,670
to do

7253
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,880
that

7254
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:41,910
a

7255
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:42,150
little

7256
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,450
bit.

7257
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:54,690
Okay,

7258
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,890
now,

7259
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:56,850
this

7260
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,030
is an

7261
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,540
exercise

7262
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:57,660
that

7263
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:57,750
you

7264
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:57,930
can

7265
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,380
continue

7266
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,860
afterward

7267
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:58,950
if

7268
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:59,040
you

7269
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,220
want

7270
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,310
to

7271
00:40:59,310 --> 00:40:59,940
extend

7272
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,240
how

7273
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,480
long

7274
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,600
you

7275
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:00,720
do

7276
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,020
this.

7277
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,350
But

7278
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:01,980
now

7279
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,310
try

7280
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:02,400
and

7281
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:02,550
do

7282
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,060
something

7283
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,330
that

7284
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:03,510
for

7285
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,690
most

7286
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:03,930
people

7287
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,170
actually

7288
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:04,320
is a

7289
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,500
little

7290
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,620
bit

7291
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,100
harder,

7292
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:05,460
which

7293
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:05,970
is to

7294
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,480
purely

7295
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:06,840
extra

7296
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,200
OSEP,

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,500
put,

7298
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,130
put

7299
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,310

7300
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:08,790
eyes

7301
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,000
or

7302
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,360
your

7303
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,020
ears

7304
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:10,470
or

7305
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,070
both,

7306
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,090
on

7307
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,660
anything

7308
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:12,750
in

7309
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:12,900
your

7310
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,350
immediate

7311
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:13,890
space.

7312
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,340
One

7313
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:14,610
thing

7314
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:14,790
and I

7315
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:14,910
would

7316
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:15,450
restrict

7317
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:15,840
that

7318
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,350
thing

7319
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:16,650
to

7320
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,280
something

7321
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:17,760
small

7322
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,180
enough

7323
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,350
that

7324
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:19,530
at

7325
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:19,800
least

7326
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:19,890
in

7327
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:20,040
your

7328
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,340
field

7329
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:20,430
of

7330
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:20,700
view,

7331
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:20,790
it

7332
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:20,940
would

7333
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,630
occupy,

7334
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:22,050
you

7335
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,470
know,

7336
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,340
20%

7337
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:23,400
of

7338
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:23,520
your

7339
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:23,790
field

7340
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:23,850
of

7341
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,060
view.

7342
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:24,270
So it

7343
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,450
doesn't

7344
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:24,540
have

7345
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:24,750
to be

7346
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,110
a pin

7347
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,500
point,

7348
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:25,740
unless

7349
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:25,830
the

7350
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,010
pin

7351
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,130
is

7352
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,490
right

7353
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:26,640
in

7354
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:26,880
front

7355
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:26,970
of

7356
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,120
you,

7357
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,210
and

7358
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:27,330
you're

7359
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:27,660
holding

7360
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:27,750
it

7361
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,900
real

7362
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,320
close,

7363
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:28,680
I

7364
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:28,800
would

7365
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:28,950
say

7366
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:29,130
look

7367
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,490
across

7368
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:29,610
the

7369
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:29,970
room,

7370
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,240
pick

7371
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:30,450
a

7372
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,050
panel

7373
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,200
on

7374
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,290
the

7375
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:31,890
wall,

7376
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,370
or

7377
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,120
you

7378
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,210
know,

7379
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:33,540
a leg

7380
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:33,720
of a

7381
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,110
table

7382
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,230
or

7383
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,620
something

7384
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:34,770
and

7385
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:34,950
try

7386
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,040
and

7387
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,190
bring

7388
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,310
as

7389
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:35,580
much

7390
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:35,670
of

7391
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,820
your

7392
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,420
attention

7393
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,200
to

7394
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:37,560
that

7395
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:37,740
as

7396
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,460
possible.

7397
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:39,480
And

7398
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,840
again,

7399
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,170
I'll

7400
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,010
take

7401
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,190
about

7402
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,430
five

7403
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,760
seconds

7404
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:41,850
of

7405
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,240
silence

7406
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:42,360
to

7407
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:42,630
allow

7408
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,810
you

7409
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,170
to

7410
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:43,830
zero

7411
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,280
cept.

7412
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:52,680
Okay,

7413
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:52,830
so

7414
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:52,980
what

7415
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,070
you

7416
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,520
probably

7417
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:53,820
found

7418
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:53,880
is

7419
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,000
that

7420
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,150
you're

7421
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,390
able

7422
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,630
to do

7423
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:54,900
that,

7424
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,200
but

7425
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:55,770
that

7426
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:56,130
some

7427
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,400
degree

7428
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:56,550
of

7429
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,690
interoception

7430
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:58,110
is

7431
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:58,620
maintained,

7432
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:58,740
it's

7433
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,160
hard

7434
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,280
to

7435
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,610
place

7436
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,300
100%

7437
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,360
of

7438
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,510
your

7439
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:00,930
attention

7440
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,050
on

7441
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,410
something

7442
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,130
externally,

7443
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:02,700
unless

7444
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:02,970
it's

7445
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,630
really

7446
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,260
exciting,

7447
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,680
really

7448
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,250
novel.

7449
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,550
If

7450
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:05,670
you've

7451
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,850
ever

7452
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:06,150
watched

7453
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,180
a

7454
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,420
really

7455
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:06,690
great

7456
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,200
movie,

7457
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,310
presumably

7458
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:08,670
you're

7459
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,300
extra

7460
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,050
accepting

7461
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:10,710
more

7462
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,830
than

7463
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:10,950
you're

7464
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,640
intercepting

7465
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:11,850
until

7466
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:12,240
something

7467
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:12,660
exciting

7468
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,050
happens.

7469
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:13,140
And

7470
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,290
then

7471
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:13,470
and

7472
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:13,590
then

7473
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:13,680
you

7474
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:13,890
feel

7475
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,220
something

7476
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,370
you're

7477
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:14,790
actually

7478
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,690
tethering

7479
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:15,930
your

7480
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,350
emotional

7481
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:16,800
experience

7482
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:16,890
to

7483
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,250
something

7484
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:17,820
external.

7485
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:18,540
And

7486
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:18,840
now,

7487
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:19,770
you

7488
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:19,950
can

7489
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,490
also

7490
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:21,240
do

7491
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:21,420
this

7492
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,140
dynamically,

7493
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,350
you

7494
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:22,530
can

7495
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:22,980
decide

7496
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,190
to

7497
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,610

7498
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,180
internally,

7499
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,270
and

7500
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:24,390
then

7501
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,900
externally,

7502
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:24,960
you

7503
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,080
can

7504
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,350
decide

7505
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:25,440
to

7506
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:25,800
split

7507
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:25,890
it

7508
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,630
50% 50%

7509
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,960
or

7510
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,240
7031

7511
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,420
can

7512
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,080
develop,

7513
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,320
you

7514
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,500
can

7515
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,040
develop

7516
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,150
a

00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:35,250
to do

7520
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:35,730
this.

7521
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,690
And

7522
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:37,230
the

7523
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:37,650
power

7524
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:37,740
of

00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,010
doing

7526
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,250
that

7527
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:38,400
is

7528
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,790
actually

7529
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,910
that

7530
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,180
when

7531
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,360
you

7532
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,600
are

7533
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:39,720
in

7534
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,380
environments

7535
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:40,530
where

7536
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:40,650
you

7537
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:40,890
feel

7538
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:41,070
like

7539
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,190
you're

7540
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,640
focused

7541
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,060
too

7542
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:42,480
much

7543
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,050
internally,

7544
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,140
and

7545
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,260
you'd

7546
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,380
like

7547
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,590
to be

7548
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,100
focused

7549
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:44,730

7550
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:45,480
externally,

7551
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:45,870
you

7552
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:46,020
can

7553
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,290
actually

7554
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:46,440
do

7555
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:46,650
that

7556
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:47,220
deliberately.

7557
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,400
But

7558
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,520
as

7559
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:47,640
you

7560
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,030
notice,

7561
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,210
it

7562
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:48,510
takes

7563
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,110
work.

7564
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:49,350
It

7565
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:49,770
involves

7566
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,220

7570
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:51,930
and

7571
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:52,050
what

7572
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,110
we

7573
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:52,290
call

7574
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:52,470

7579
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:54,600
and

7580
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,200
narrowing

7581
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:55,380

7583
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:56,580

7594
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,230
And

00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,560
yet,

00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,100

7723
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:42,870
self

7724
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,470
relative

7725
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:43,560
to

7726
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:43,650
the

7727
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:43,890
rest

7728
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:43,950
of

7729
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:44,040
your

7730
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,400
body.

7731
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:46,740
These

7732
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,670
exercises

7733
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,150
are

7734
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,110
really

7735
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:49,680
what

7736
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:49,770
are

7737
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:49,890
at

7738
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:49,980
the

7739
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,550
core

7740
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:50,700
of

7741
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,090
these

7742
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:51,780
development

7743
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:51,900
of

7744
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,410
emotional

7745
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:52,800
bonds.

7746
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,010
Because

7747
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:53,310
as we

7748
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:53,700
mentioned

7749
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,300
before,

7750
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,810
these

7751
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,110
four

7752
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:55,560
things,

7753
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:55,740
the

7754
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,490
gaze,

7755
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,810
vocalization,

7756
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:58,410
touch

7757
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:58,620
an

7758
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,220
effect,

7759
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,150
those

7760
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:00,780
are

7761
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,200
happening

7762
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,470
very

7763
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,130
dynamically.

7764
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:02,460
So if

7765
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:02,850
somebody

7766
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:03,210
winks

7767
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:03,330
at

7768
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:03,600
you,

7769
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:03,750
you're

7770
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:03,960
paying

7771
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,320
attention

7772
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,410
to

7773
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:04,560
their

7774
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,920
wink,

7775
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,070
but

7776
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:05,220
then

7777
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:05,430
you're

7778
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:05,880
also

7779
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,210
notice

7780
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:06,360
how

7781
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,510
you

7782
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:06,960
feel,

7783
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:07,500
then

7784
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:07,560
they

7785
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,770
might

7786
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:07,920
say

7787
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,280
something,

7788
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,400
then

7789
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:08,490
you

7790
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:08,700
might

7791
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:08,820
say

7792
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,000
something,

7793
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,120
this

7794
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,210
is

7795
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:09,630
very

7796
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:10,230
dynamic.

7797
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,590
So if

7798
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:10,680
it

7799
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:10,950
seems

7800
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:11,520
overwhelming

7801
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,640
to

7802
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:11,940
try

7803
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,090
and

7804
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,020
intercept

7805
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,110
an

7806
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:13,530
extra

7807
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:13,770
step,

7808
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:13,860
and

7809
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:13,980
then

7810
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,370
shift

7811
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:14,460
the

7812
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:14,880
balance,

7813
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:15,150
you

7814
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:15,270
do

7815
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,480
that

7816
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,690
all

7817
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:15,810
the

7818
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,170
time,

7819
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:16,290
your

7820
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:16,530
brain

7821
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:16,620
and

7822
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:16,800
nervous

7823
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,100
system

7824
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,250
are

7825
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,030
fantastic

7826
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:18,120
at

7827
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,360
doing

7828
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:18,660
this.

7829
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:19,500
Now,

7830
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:20,370
some

7831
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:20,700
people

7832
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:20,850
have

7833
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:20,910
a

7834
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,300
very

7835
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:21,510
hard

7836
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,780
time

7837
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,350
breaking

7838
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:22,680
out

7839
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,070
of a

7840
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,460
very

7841
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:23,940
strongly

7842
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,750
interoceptive

7843
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,110
mode.

7844
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:25,800
Some

7845
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,010
people

7846
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:26,130
have

7847
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:26,160
a

7848
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,400
harder

7849
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,850
time

7850
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:27,720
breaking

7851
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:27,990
out

7852
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:28,080
of

7853
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,260
their

7854
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,650
extra

7855
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:29,160
receptive

7856
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,550
mode.

7857
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:30,450
It's

7858
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:30,690
very

7859
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,170
interesting

7860
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:31,320
to

7861
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:31,860
note

7862
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,730
the

7863
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:32,910
the

7864
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:33,300

7865
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:33,420
to

7866
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:33,750
which

7867
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,110
we

7868
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:34,380
have

7869
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,100
biases

7870
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,190
and

7871
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,490
how

7872
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,300
interoceptive

7873
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:36,390
or

7874
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,780

7876
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:37,410
we

7877
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:37,710
are.

7878
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:38,340
Remember

7879
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:38,550
those

7880
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:38,790
three

7881
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,240
axes

7882
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,360
that

7883
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:39,480
we

7884
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:39,750
talked

7885
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,930
about

7886
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,440
earlier,

7887
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:40,770
you

7888
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,160
have

7889
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:41,820
valence,

7890
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,000
good

7891
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,090
or

7892
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:42,480
bad,

7893
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,570
you

7894
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:42,690
have

7895
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:43,410
alertness,

7896
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:44,400
alert,

7897
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,490
or

7898
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:44,880
calm

7899
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,060
and

7900
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,210
you

7901
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:45,600
have

7902
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,130
interoceptive

7903
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,250

7907
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,260
right.

7908
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,650
And

7909
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,430
it's

7910
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:50,640
going

7911
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:50,760
to

7912
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,000
differ

7913
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,360
across

7914
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:51,480
the

7915
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:51,900
day,

7916
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:52,110
it's

7917
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:52,320
going

7918
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:52,440

lifetime.

7923
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,030
It's

7924
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,540
certainly

7925
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:54,720
going

7926
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:54,810

00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:55,950
whatever

7931
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,160
it is

7932
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,280
that

7933
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:56,400
you're

7934
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:56,940
engaged

7935
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:57,090
in.

7936
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,870
But

7937
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:58,680
early

7938
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:58,800
in

7939
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,490
development,

7940
00:44:59,550 --> 00:44:59,790
you

7941
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:00,000
start

7942
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,390
off

7943
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,510
with

7944
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:00,630
this

7945
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,380
interoceptive

7946
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,010
bias,

7947
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:02,700
you're

7948
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,330
starting

7949
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:03,480
to

7950
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,050
develop

7951
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,100
expectations,

7952
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,000
predictions

7953
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:06,300
about

7954
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:06,510
how

7955
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:06,660
the

7956
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,050

7957
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:07,320
world

7958
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:07,440
is

7959
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:07,650
going

7960
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:07,740
to

7961
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,160
work.

7962
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,150
And

7963
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:09,990
you're

7964
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,410
trying

7965
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:10,500
to

7966
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,740
figure

7967
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:10,920
out

7968
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,010
the

7969
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,120
reliability

7970
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:12,270
of

7971
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:12,690

7972
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,050
events

7973
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,170
and

7974
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:13,680
people,

7975
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:14,340
and

7976
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:14,850
where

7977
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,270
things

7978
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:15,540
are

7979
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,380
reliable.

7980
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,250
When

7981
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:17,790
people

7982
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,060
are

7983
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,840
reliable,

7984
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,320
we

7985
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,470
are

7986
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:19,770
able

7987
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:19,920
to

7988
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,250
give

7989
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:20,640
up

7990
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,060
more

7991
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:21,180

7992
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,330
our

7993
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,200
interoception.

7994
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,500
There's

7995
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,040
literally

7996
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,670
trust

7997
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,120
that

7998
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,540
our

7999
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,410
interoceptive

8000
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:25,860

8001
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,010
our

8002
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:26,400
internal

8003
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:26,670
needs

8004
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:26,820
will

8005
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:26,970
be

8006
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:27,360
met

8007
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,110
through

8008
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,740
bonds

8009
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:28,860
and

8010
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,310
actions

8011
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:29,400
of

8012
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:29,850
others.

8013
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:30,690
This

8014
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,260
starts

8015
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:31,350
to

8016
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:31,710
veer

8017
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:32,160
toward

8018
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,820
the

8019
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,330
discussion

8020
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:33,570
about

8021
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,050
neglect

8022
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,140
and

8023
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,500
trauma,

8024
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:34,680
we

8025
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:34,740
are

8026
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:34,950
going

8027
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,070
to

8028
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:35,520
devote

8029
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,000
entire

8030
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,540
episodes

8031
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:36,870
probably

8032
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:36,960
an

8033
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,290
entire

8034
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:37,680
month

8035
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,190
to

8036
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:38,730
trauma

8037
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:38,850
and

8038
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,600
PTSD.

8039
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,080
But

8040
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,440
these,

8041
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,250
those

8042
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,490
have

8043
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,180
roots

8044
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:42,450
in

8045
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:42,600
what

8046
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:42,900
we're

8047
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:43,350
talking

8048
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:43,590
about

8049
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:43,830
now.

8050
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:43,920
And

8051
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,010
it's

8052
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:44,490
important

8053
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:44,670
to

8054
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,300
internalize

8055
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:45,420
and

8056
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,780
understand

8057
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:45,900
what

8058
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:45,990
we're

8059
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:46,260
talking

8060
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:46,470
about

8061
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,710
now

8062
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,800
in

8063
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,040
order

8064
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,160
to

8065
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,310
get

8066
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:47,460
the

8067
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:47,910
most

8068
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:48,030
out

8069
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:48,120
of

8070
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,300
those

8071
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,630
future

8072
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,440
conversations.

8073
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,060
So if

8074
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,210
all

8075
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:51,270
of

8076
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,390
this

8077
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:51,660
seems

8078
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,020
like

8079
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:52,440
a lot

8080
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:52,500
of

8081
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,160
information,

8082
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,310
and

8083
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:53,700
very

8084
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,600
complicated,

8085
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:54,900
I

8086
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:55,140
just

8087
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:55,500
invite

8088
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:55,650
you

8089
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:55,800
to

8090
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:55,980
pay

8091
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,400
attention

8092
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:56,550
from

8093
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:56,790
time

8094
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,880
to

8095
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,270
time

8096
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:57,570
how

8097
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:57,780
much

8098
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:57,870
you

8099
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:58,290
happen

8100
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:58,560
to be

8101
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,340
intercepting

8102
00:45:59,340 --> 00:45:59,430
or

8103
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,880
extra

8104
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,330
cepting.

8105
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,080
Because

8106
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:01,950
emotions

8107
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,220
and

8108
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:02,340
the

8109
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,060
intensity

8110
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,150
of

8111
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:03,360
those

8112
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,020
emotions

8113
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:04,860
will

8114
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,460
grow

8115
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:05,640
or

8116
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,150
shrink,

8117
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,450
depending

8118
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:06,570
on

8119
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:06,720
how

8120
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:06,960
much

8121
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,110
we're

8122
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,890
intercepting.

8123
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,160
If we

8124
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,250
are

8125
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:08,640
feeling

8126
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,630
extremely

8127
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,200
sad.

8128
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,190
And

8129
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:12,630
there

8130
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,870
is an

8131
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,380
outside

8132
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:13,890

8133
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,790
that

8134
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:15,000
made

8135
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,150
us

8136
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:15,570
sad,

8137
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,140
chances

8138
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,620
are,

8139
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:16,980
there's

8140
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,130
going

8141
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:17,310
to be

8142
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:17,370
a

8143
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:17,880
balance,

8144
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,060
but

8145
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,330
that

8146
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:18,600
the

8147
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,170
extreme

8148
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:19,560
grief,

8149
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:19,650
the

8150
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,220
extreme

8151
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:20,910
sadness

8152
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,210
is

8153
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:21,420
going

8154
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,540
to

8155
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:21,720
lead

8156
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,170
us to

8157
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,890
mostly

8158
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,760
intercept.

8159
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,660
Whereas

8160
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:25,170
when,

8161
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:25,830
when

8162
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:25,920
we're

8163
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,310
feeling

8164
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,820
extremely

8165
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,210
happy,

8166
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:27,330
the

8167
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:27,630
same

8168
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:27,780
is

8169
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,200
true,

8170
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:28,500
you

8171
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:28,680
know,

8172
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,100
something

8173
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:29,430
great

8174
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,820
happens

8175
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:29,910
in

8176
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,000
the

8177
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,480
world.

8178
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:30,750
And

8179
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:30,870
we're

8180
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:31,020
just

8181
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,200
going

8182
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,290
to

8183
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:31,590
feel

8184
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:31,680
it

8185
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,190
most

8186
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,280
of

8187
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,430
our

8188
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:33,060
perception,

8189
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:33,270
most

8190
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,360
of

8191
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:33,480
our

8192
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:33,930
awareness

8193
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:34,050
is

8194
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:34,230
going

8195
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:34,440
to be

8196
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:34,710
on an

8197
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,220
internal

8198
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:35,610
state.

8199
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,180
So we

8200
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:36,330
are

8201
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:36,780
always

8202
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,260
tethered

8203
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:37,410
to

8204
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:37,530
the

8205
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:37,980
outside

8206
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,370
world

8207
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,640
to

8208
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:38,880
some

8209
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,120
degree

8210
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:39,210
or

8211
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:39,630
another.

8212
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:40,200
It's

8213
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,620
that

8214
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:40,830
was

8215
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,010
true

8216
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:41,160
when

8217
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:41,220
you

8218
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:41,340
were

8219
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:41,460
an

8220
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:41,940
infant.

8221
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,300
And

8222
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,420
it

8223
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:42,690
was

8224
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,140
true

8225
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:43,260
when

8226
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:43,350
you're

8227
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,440
an

8228
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,100
adolescent.

8229
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,280
And

8230
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:44,430
it's

8231
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:44,820
true

8232
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:45,870
as an

8233
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:46,320
adult.

8234
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:46,860
So

8235
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,370
now I

8236
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:47,550
want

8237
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:47,610
to

8238
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:47,790
just

8239
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,450
pause,

8240
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:49,740
just

8241
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,250
shelve

8242
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:50,400
the

8243
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,000
discussion

8244
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,330
about

8245
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:51,960
interoception

8246
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,260
extra

8247
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,710
reception

8248
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,860
for a

8249
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:53,220
moment.

8250
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:53,580
And I

8251
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:53,850
want

8252
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:53,910
to

8253
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:54,150
talk

8254
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,630
about

8255
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,170
what

8256
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:55,350
is

8257
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,130
arguably

8258
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:56,310
the

8259
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:56,700
second

8260
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,060
most

8261
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,240
if

8262
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:57,750
not

8263
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:58,890
equally

8264
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,490
important

8265
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,720
aspect

8266
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:00,810
of

8267
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:00,960
your

8268
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,710
development,

8269
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:02,430
as it

8270
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:02,880
relates

8271
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,150
to

8272
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,170
emotionality.

8273
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:04,680
And

8274
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:04,980
as it

8275
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,400
relates

8276
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,550
to

8277
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:05,820
this,

8278
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:06,060
what

8279
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,180
I

8280
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,510
called

8281
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:06,990
trust.

8282
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,140
But

8283
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,260
this

8284
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:07,650
ability

8285
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:07,770
to

8286
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,460
predict

8287
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,880
whether

8288
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:08,910
or

8289
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,150
not

8290
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,450
things

8291
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:09,540
in

00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,630
the

world

8295
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:10,680
are

8296
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,430
reliable

8297
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,730
or

8298
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,150
not

8299
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,260
reliable

8300
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:13,380
in

8301
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:13,620
terms

8302
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:13,680
of

8303
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:13,830
their

8304
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,460
ability

8305
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:14,880
to

8306
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,210
help

8307
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:15,420
you

8308
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:15,690
meet

8309
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:15,870
your

8310
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:16,590
interoceptive

8311
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:17,010
needs.

8312
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,490
And

8313
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:17,670
that

8314
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,210
period

8315
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,020
is

8316
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,220
puberty.

8317
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,180
So up

8318
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:21,390
until

8319
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:21,660
now,

8320
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:21,840
we've

8321
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:21,990
been

8322
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:22,320
talking

8323
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:22,590
mainly

8324
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:22,770
about

8325
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,400
psychology,

8326
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:23,700
not a

8328
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:23,910
of

8329
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,360
biology

8330
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:24,450
and

8331
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:24,660
not a

8332

8333
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:24,900
of

8334
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,470
mechanism.

8335
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:25,620
And

8336
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:25,770
now

8337
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:25,860
we're

8338
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:25,980
going

8339
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,190
to

8340
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:26,970
transition

8341
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,390
into

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:27,720
talking

8343
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,930
about

8344
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:28,470
mechanism,

8345
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,010
hormones,

8346
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:29,790
receptors,

8347
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,630
etc.

8348
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:31,950
puberty

8349
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,760
is a

8350
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,450
absolute

8351
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,080
biological

8352
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,530
event.

8353
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,460
It

8354
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:35,880
has a

8355
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,510
beginning.

8356
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,290
And

8357
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,560
it

8358
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,070
has a

8359
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:38,490
specific

8360
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,180
definition,

8361
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,570
which

8362
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:39,690
is

8363
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:39,810
the

8364
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:40,470
transition

8365
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,010
into

8366
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,670
reproductive

8367
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,330
maturity.

8368
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,930
So

8369
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:43,050
there

8370
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,110
are a

8371
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:43,260
lot

8372
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,320
of

8373
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,770
hormonal

8374
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:44,220
changes.

8375
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:44,640
Yes,

8376
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:44,790
there

8377
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,820
are

8378
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,000
also

8379
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,180
a lot

8380
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:45,240
of

8381
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,540
brain

8382
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:45,960
changes,

8383
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,050
and

8384
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:46,200
most

8385
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,380
people

8386
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:46,530
don't

8387
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:46,920
realize

8388
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,070
it,

8389
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:47,310
but

8390
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:47,400
the

8391
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:47,730
brain

8392
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,330
changes

8393
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:48,690
occur.

8394
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,290
First,

8395
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:49,560
the

8396
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:49,980
brain

8397
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,370
turns

8398
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:50,640
on

8399
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:50,730
the

8400
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,210
hormone

8401
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,810
systems

8402
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,200
that

8403
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:52,650
allow

8404
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,100
puberty

8405
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,280
to

8406
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:53,760
occur.

8407
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:56,010
puberty

8408
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:56,430
is

8409
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:56,910
occurring

8410
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,600
earlier

8411
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:58,440
nowadays

8412
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,620
than

8413
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:58,770
it

8414
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,490
did

8415
00:47:59,490 --> 00:47:59,580
in

8416
00:47:59,580 --> 00:47:59,670
the

8417
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,180
past.

8418
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:01,710
The

8419
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,100
current

8420
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:02,610
numbers

8421
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:02,790
that

8422
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:02,970
I was

8423
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:03,180
able

8424
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,240
to

8425
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:03,630
find

8426
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:03,870
is

8427
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,170
that

8428
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,130
in

8429
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:05,940
females,

8430
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:06,720
girls,

8431
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,080
the

8432
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:07,620
transition

8433
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:07,710
is

8434
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:08,130
starting

8435
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,550
around

8436
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:08,940
age

8437
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:09,390
10.

8438
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:09,840
Whereas

8439
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:09,930
in

8440
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,260
boys,

8441
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,410
it's

8442
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:10,800
about

8443
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,190
age

8444
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,760
12,

8445
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,150
that's

8446
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,360
going

8447
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:12,450
to

8448
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:12,930
differ

8449
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,530
by

8450
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:13,710
way

8451
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:13,830
of a

8452
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,100
number

8453
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:14,160
of

8454
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,430
different

8455
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:14,880
factors.

8456
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,030
Those

8457
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,180
are

8458
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:15,930
averages.

8459
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,800
So

8460
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,370
depends

8461
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:17,430
on

8462
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,610
where

8463
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:17,760
you

8464
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,000
are

8465
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,120
in

8466
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,180
the

8467
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,600
world

8468
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:18,990
depends

8469
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,170
on

8470
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:19,290
all

8471
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:19,560
sorts

8472
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:19,650
of

8473
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:19,980
things.

8474
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:20,520
One

8475
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:20,610
of

8476
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:20,700
the

8477
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,540
primary

8478
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,170
triggers

8479
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,320
for

8480
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:22,860
puberty

8481
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:23,580
is

8482
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:23,910
actually

8483
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:24,270
body

8484
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:24,750
fat.

8485
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:25,890
This

8486
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:25,980
is

8487
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,580
interesting.

8488
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,870
The

8489
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:28,590
peptide

8490
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,280
hormone

8491
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,090
leptin.

8492
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:31,350
Some

8493
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:31,530
people

8494
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:31,710
call

8495
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:31,800
it a

8496
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,220
peptide.

8497
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,340
Some

8498
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:32,520
people

8499
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:32,700
call

8500
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:32,790
it a

8501
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:33,240
hormone,

8502
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,390
but

8503
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:33,540
it

8504
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,080
meets

8505
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,320
both

8506
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:34,890
definitions,

8507
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,190
depending

8508
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,310
on

8509
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:35,400
how

8510
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:35,490
you

8511
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:35,670
look

8512
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:35,970
at it

8513
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,720
is

8514
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,230
made

8515
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:37,590
by

8516
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,220
fat.

8517
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:38,730
So

8518
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:39,450
leptin

8519
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:40,470
had a

8520
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,650
lot

8521
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:40,710
of

8522
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,610
popularity

8523
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,000
in

8524
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,120
the

8525
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,780
90s

8526
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,380
because

8527
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:43,860
it

8528
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,100
was

8529
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,790
discovered

8530
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:45,060
as

8531
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,300
being

8532
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,660
produced

8533
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:45,810
by

8534
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,350
fat.

8535
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,100
And

8536
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,250
it

8537
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:47,400
was

8538
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,640
seen

8539
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:47,760
in

8540
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,060
animal

8541
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,450
studies

8542
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:48,600
that

8543
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:48,690
it

8544
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:48,870
could

8545
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,320
promote

8546
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,130
leanness,

8547
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:50,460
it

8548
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:50,700
actually

8549
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,630
communicates

8550
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:51,750
to

8551
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:51,840
the

00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,290
brain

8553
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,500
that

8554
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:52,710
there's

8555
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,100
enough

8556
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,460
body

8557
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:53,820
fat

8558
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:53,970
in

8559
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:54,360
order

8560
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,380
to

8561
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:55,860
allow

8562
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:55,980
the

8563
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,610

8564
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,300
factors

8565
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:57,480
and

8566
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,050
processes

8567
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:58,140
to

8568
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,440
occur

8569
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:58,650
to

8570
00:48:58,650 --> 00:48:59,160
liberate

8571
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,430
more

8572
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,730
fat.

8573
00:48:59,760 --> 00:48:59,880
This

8574
00:48:59,880 --> 00:48:59,970
is

8575
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:00,240
why

8576
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:00,660
people

8577
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:00,780
have

8578
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,080
trouble

8579
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,410
losing

8580
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:01,590
that

8581
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:01,920
last

8582
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,250
five

8583
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:02,730
pounds.

8584
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:02,880
It's

8585
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,210
because

8586
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:03,570
leptin

8587
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:03,900

8589
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:04,260
very

8590
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,620
low.

8591
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:04,890
This

8592
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:05,040
was

8593
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:05,280
actually

8594
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,370
the

8595
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:05,820
basis

8596
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:05,940

8597
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,060
the

8598
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:06,270
whole

8599
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:06,600

8600
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:06,810

8606
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:08,910
was

8607
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:09,030
if

8608
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,360
you

8609
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:10,620
eat a

8611
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:11,220

you

8620
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:14,310
can

8621
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:14,700

8622
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:14,790

there's

8627
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:15,810

leptin.

00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,610
that's

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:17,790
the

00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:19,620
just

00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:20,550

00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:21,930
probably

00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,350
both.

8650
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:23,130

There

8673
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:30,900

leptin

8689
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:36,720

00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:41,580
would

00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,000
not

8698
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,960

8703
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:44,730
and

8704
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:44,880
you

8705
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,150
could

8706
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,810
accelerate

8707
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:45,930
the

8713
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,270
So

00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:48,540
more

8720
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,220
that's

8721
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,580
true.

8722
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,240
leptin

8723
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:51,420
is

8724
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:51,900
also

8725
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,440
involved

8726
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:52,800

00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:53,370

generally,

8734
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,560
and

8735
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:55,680
it's

8736
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,100
interesting,

8737
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:56,760
very

8738
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,150
obese

8739
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:57,810
children

8740
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:58,650
don't

8741
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:59,370
necessarily

8742
00:49:59,370 --> 00:49:59,700
undergo

8743
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,000
puberty

8744
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,180
The

00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,290
sometimes

8747
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:01,410
they

8748
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:01,800
do,

8749
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,340
but

8750
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:02,580
they

8751
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:02,790
do

8752
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,000
tend

8753
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,210
to be

8754
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:03,690

their

8758
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:04,890
actually

8759
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:05,100
grow

8760
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,310
more

8761
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,790
quickly

8762
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:05,910
and

8763
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,000
they

8764
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,180
tend

8765
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:06,240
to

8766
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:06,480
have

8767
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:06,870
higher

8768
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,110
bone

8769
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:07,530
density

8770
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:07,770
because

8771
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,070
leptin

8772
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:08,190
is

8773
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,460
also

8774
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,850
involved

8775
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:08,940
in

8776
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,210
bone

8777
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:09,810
density.

8778
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:12,630
The

8779
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:12,840
whole

8780
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,080
issue

8781
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,170
of

8782
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:13,560
onset

8783
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:13,620
of

8784
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,250
puberty

8785
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,910
also

8786
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,210
has

8787
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:15,390
some

8788
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:15,810
really

8789
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,440
interesting

8790
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,040
social

8791
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,520
effects.

8792
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,390
And I

8793
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:18,630
want

8794
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,720
to

8795
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,200
really

8796
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,770
highlight

8797
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,040
that

8798
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,460
most

8799
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:20,550
of

8800
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:20,760
these

8801
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,300
effects

8802
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:21,540
are

8803
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:21,690
so

8804
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:21,900
called

8805
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,440
pheromone

8806
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:22,740
effects.

8807
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:23,040
Remember,

8808
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,100
a

8809
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,670
hormone

8810
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,000
is a

8811
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,450
substance

8812
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:24,870
secreted

8813
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:25,020
from

8814
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:25,140
one

8815
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,380

8816
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,440
of

8817
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:25,500
the

8818
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:25,770
body

8819
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,340
travels

8820
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:26,820
and

8821
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,330
impacts

8822
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:27,750
tissues

8823
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:27,840
and

8824
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,290
cells

8825
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:28,800
elsewhere

8826
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:28,890
in

8827
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:28,950
the

8828
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:29,250
body.

8829
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,370
A

8830
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,180
pheromone

8831
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:30,930
is a

8832
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,410
chemical

8833
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:31,590
that's

8834
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:32,070
released

8835
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:32,490
by

8836
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:32,910
one

8837
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:33,210
member

8838
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:33,360
of a

8839
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:33,870
species

8840
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,020
that

8841
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,260
goes

8842
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,380
in

8843
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:34,920
acts

8844
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,610
on

8845
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:35,760
and

8846
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,390
impacts

8847
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:36,750
other

8848
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,080
members

8849
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,170
of

8850
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:37,380
that

8851
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,800
species

8852
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:37,950
or

8853
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:38,430
even

8854
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:38,910
other

8855
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,510
species.

8856
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,020
So

8857
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,200
for

8858
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,500
instance,

8859
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,280
rodents

8860
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:41,610
are

8861
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:41,940
very

8862
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:42,300
good

8863
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:42,510
at

8864
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:43,350
detecting

8865
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:44,280
the

8866
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:45,150
the

8867
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:45,720
urine

8868
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:45,960
and

8869
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,080
the

8870
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,440
scent

8871
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,010
markings

8872
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:47,220
of

8873
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,580
large

8874
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,330
carnivores

8875
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:48,600
that

8876
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:48,780
want

8877
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:48,840
to

8878
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,080
eat

8879
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,350
them.

8880
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:49,620
So

8881
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:49,860
that's

8882
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:49,920
a

8883
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,640
pheromonal

8884
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,480
interaction.

8885
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,040
whether

8886
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,070
or

8887
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:53,310
not

8888
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:53,490
they're

8889
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,090
pheromonal

8890
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:54,420
effects

8891
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:54,540
in

8892
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:54,960
humans

8893
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,200
is

8894
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:55,620
very

8895
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,160
debated.

8896
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,520
I did

8897
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:56,550
a

8898
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:56,910

8900
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,240

8901
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:57,360

8902
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:57,780

8903
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:57,810
a

8904
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:57,960
little

8905
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,230
while

8906
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,470
ago

8907
00:50:58,470 --> 00:50:58,680
about

8908
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:58,830
some

8909
00:50:58,830 --> 00:50:59,250

8910
00:50:59,250 --> 00:50:59,490
effects

8911
00:50:59,490 --> 00:50:59,610
that

8912
00:50:59,610 --> 00:50:59,670
were

8913
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:00,090

8914
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:00,180

8915
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,600
humans.

8916
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:01,020
And I

8917
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:01,650
had a

8918
00:51:01,650 --> 00:51:01,920

8919
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:01,980
of

8920
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,550
people

8921
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:03,480
come

8922
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:03,810
at me

8923
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,140
saying,

8924
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:04,560
Look,

8925
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:04,920
it's

8926
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,190
never

8927
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:05,490
really

8928
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:05,700
been

8929
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,060

8930
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,180

8931
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:06,630
humans

8932
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,780
that

8933
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,050
there's

8934
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:07,140
a

8935
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:07,860
pheromonal

8936
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:08,250
vomer,

8937
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:08,490
what's

8938
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:08,670
called

8939
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:08,730
the

8940
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,390
vomeronasal

8941
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:09,750
organ,

8942
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,870
there's

8943
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:10,050
something

8944
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:10,260
called

8945
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:10,890
Jacobson's

8946
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,370
organ.

8947
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:11,820
It's

8948
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,750
rudimentary.

8949
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,380
Some

8950
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:13,590
people

8951
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:13,860
have

8952
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:13,950
it,

8953
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:14,130
some

8954
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:14,340
people

8955
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:14,790
don't.

8956
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:15,840
very

8957
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,590
controversial.

8958
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:16,770
So I

8959
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:17,010
want

8960
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:17,070
to

8961
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:17,340
point

8962
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:17,550
out

8963
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:17,700
that

8964
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,090
human

8965
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:18,480
pheromone

8966
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:18,900
effects

8967
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,110
are

8968
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:19,830
controversial,

8969
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,130
although

8970
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:20,190
I

8971
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,430
think

8972
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:20,760
there's,

8973
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,420
in my

8974
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,080
opinion,

8975
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,650
there's

8976
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:23,040
ample

8977
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,460
evidence

8978
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:23,700
for

8979
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:23,970
them

8980
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,810
synchronization

8981
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:24,870
of

8982
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:25,260
menstrual

8983
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,830
cycles.

8984
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:26,370
For

8985
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:27,030
many

8986
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:27,300
people

8987
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:27,870
report,

8988
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,290
then

8989
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:28,530
people

8990
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:28,860
say,

8991
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:29,460
there's

8992
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:29,610
some

8993
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:29,970
studies

8994
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,060
that

8995
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:30,240
show

8996
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,390
that

8997
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,510
it's

8998
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:30,750
not

8999
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,230
true,

9000
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,040
then

9001
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,190
there

9002
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:32,250
have

9003
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:32,580
been

9004
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:33,000

9006
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:33,750

9007
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,350
very

9008
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,130
impressive

9009
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,240
pheromonal

9010
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,660

9011
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,050

00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:38,970
female

9013
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,840

9014
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:40,560
being

9015
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:40,770
able

9016
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:40,890
to

9017
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:41,340
detect

9018
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:41,490
the

9019
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:42,060

9020
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:42,360

9021
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:42,690
their

9022
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,290
significant

9023
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:43,680
others

9024
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:44,190
on T

9025
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:44,520
shirts

9026
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:44,640
that

9027
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:44,790
were

9028
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:45,180
washed

9029
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:45,480
several

9030
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:45,810
times,

9031
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:45,870
so

9032
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:45,990
they

9033
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,230
can't

9034
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,740
consciously

9035
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,160
perceive

9036
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:47,250
it.

9037
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:47,340
But

9038
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:47,430
they

9039
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:47,580
say

9040
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:47,790
this

9041
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:47,940
one

9042
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,300
smells

9043
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:48,690
like

9044
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,350
them.

9045
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:49,620
This

9046
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:49,770
one

9047
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:50,040
smells

9048
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,190
like

9049
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:50,340
my

9050
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:50,760
partner.

9051
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:51,180
And

9052
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,720
indeed,

9053
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,130
the

9054
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,340
The

9055
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:53,670
match

9056
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,970
was

9057
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:54,270
way

9058
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:54,690
above

9059
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,350
chance.

9060
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,130
So

9061
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,400
there

9062
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:56,610
does

9063
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:56,790
seem

9064
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,210
to be

9065
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:57,750
weak

9066
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,260
pheromonal

9067
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,590
effects,

9068
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:58,680
at

9069
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:58,860
least

9070
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,130
in my

9071
00:51:59,130 --> 00:51:59,490
opinion,

9072
00:51:59,490 --> 00:51:59,610
when

9073
00:51:59,610 --> 00:51:59,730
I

9074
00:51:59,730 --> 00:51:59,940
look

9075
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,030
at

9076
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:00,090
the

9077
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:00,480
data,

9078
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:00,810
but

9079
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,110
much

9080
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:01,260
more

9081
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,500
needs

9082
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:01,680
to be

9083
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,010
done.

9084
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:02,460
So

9085
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:02,640
one

9086
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:02,760
of

9087
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:02,850
the

9088
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:03,060
more

9089
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:03,870
interesting

9090
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:04,830
pheromone

9091
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,250
effects

9092
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:05,730
that

9093
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:06,510
impacts

9094
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:07,110
puberty,

9095
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:07,230
at

9096
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:07,500
least

9097
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:07,620
in

9098
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,040
animal

9099
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,610

9100
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,240
is

9101
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,300
the

9102
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,450
so

9103
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:09,660
called

9104
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,290
vandenberghe

9105
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:10,650
effect,

9106
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:10,830
which

9107
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,460
is if

9108
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:11,610
you

9109
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:11,880
take

9110
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,600
a pre

9111
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,260
pubertal

9112
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:13,980
female,

9113
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,910
so a

9114
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:15,420
female

9115
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:15,540
that

9116
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:15,690
has

9117
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:15,960
not

9118
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,710
undergone

9119
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,220
sexual

9120
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:17,970
maturation,

9121
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:19,140
and

9122
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:19,530
you

9123
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,070
introduce

9124
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:20,190
a

9125
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:20,970
novel

9126
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,390
male

9127
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:21,570
that

9128
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:21,720
is

9129
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,080
not

9130
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,140
the

9131
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:22,710
father

9132
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,040
or a

9133
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,580
brother,

9134
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:23,880
not a

9135
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,450
sibling,

9136
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:25,680
she

9137
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:25,800
will

9138
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,550
undergo

9139
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,600
puberty

9140
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:28,320
almost

9141
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:28,950
immediately.

9142
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,580
So

9143
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:29,730
this

9144
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:29,850
is

9145
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:30,120
really

9146
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,600
striking.

9147
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,750
For

9148
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,050
years.

9149
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:31,230
This

9150
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,380
was

9151
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,620
thought

9152
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:31,920
not

9153
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,040
to

9154
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,460

9158
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,630
But

9159
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:33,720
there

9160
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:33,870
was a

00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:54,450
the

9211
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,000

9219
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:04,860
And

9220
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,160
that

9221
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,580

9222
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:05,970
seems

9223
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,150
to be

9224
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,630

9225
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,990

9232
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:08,820
So

9233
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,240
another,

9234
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:09,480
you

00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:09,570
know,

9236
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:09,840
that

9237
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,440
these

9238
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,640
interpretation

9239
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,730
of

00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,180
this,

9241
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:12,510
and I

9242
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:12,660
want

9243
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:12,780

9244
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:13,350
really

9245
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,250
highlight

9246
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:14,370
that

9247
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:14,520
this

9248
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:14,700
is,

9249
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:15,150
these

9250
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:15,270

9251
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,630

9253
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,920
But

9254
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,240
the

9255
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:18,360
way

9256
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:18,570
this

9257
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:18,960
works

9258
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,110
is

9259
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,440
that

9260
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:20,760

her,

9272
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,450
then

9273
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,050
her

9274
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:28,320

but

9286
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:32,100
if

9287
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,520
he's

9288
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,480
gone,

9289
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:33,990

up,

9294
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:36,420
there's

9295
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:36,480
a

9302
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:40,380
and

9303
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,920
essentially,

9304
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,340

00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:42,420

lost.

9309
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:44,040
Now,

9310
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,250
whether

9612
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:57,510
Because

00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:57,990
the

00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:02,640

9630
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,240

9633
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:03,840
And

9634
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:03,930
if

9642
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:06,750
goes

9643
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:06,900
too

9644
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,350
high,

9645
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:07,710
they

9648
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:08,940

9652
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,960
like

luteinizing

9655
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,070
it's

9656
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:11,370
a way

9657
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:11,610
to

9658
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:11,880

loop.

9663
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:13,140
It

9664
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,410
basically

9665
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:13,500
is

9666
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:13,620
like

9667
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:13,680

the

9672
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,270
It's

9673
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:15,420
more

9674
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:15,870
complicated

9675
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:15,960
than

9676
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,200
that.

9677
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:16,470
But

9678
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:17,280
once

00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,360

too

9682
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:18,900
high

9683
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:18,990
in

00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:19,050

9686
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:19,470
it

9687
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:19,770
shuts

9688
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:20,220
down.

9689
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:20,580
But

9690
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,180

9704
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:25,770
so

00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:25,920
that

9712
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,740

essentially,

00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:13,950
of

9828
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:16,530
so

9829
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:16,650
they

9830
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:16,890

9844
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,910

9886
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,560
also

9887
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:34,680

So

00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:43,710
they're

they're

9925
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:50,250
So

9926
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:50,670
that's

9927
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:50,820
how

9940
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,200
And

9941
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,380
then

9942
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:55,620
this

9943
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,250

they're

00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:26,550
is to

10010
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,120
take

10011
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:27,540
a

10012
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:28,770
child

10013
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:28,890
that

10014
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:29,130
was a

10015
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,060
generalist,

10016
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:30,570
and

10017
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:30,660
to

10018
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:30,870
make

10019
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,990
them

10020
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:31,050
a

specialist.

10022
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,070
And

10023
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:32,190
this

10024
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:32,310
is

10025
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:32,700
very

10026
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,270
important

10027
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:33,660
as it

10028
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:33,960
relates

10029
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,020

emotionality.

10034
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:36,780
But

10035
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:36,960
it's

10036
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,530
important

10037
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:38,820

10069
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,220
Sure,

10070
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,370
there

10071
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:50,400

10075
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,020

10076
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,170

and

10083
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:54,630
things

10084
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:54,720
like

10085
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:54,810
that

10086
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,020
a lot

10087
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,080
of

10088
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:55,290
that's

10089
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:55,800
programmed

10090
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:55,980
into

10091
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,070
the

10092
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:56,550
genome.

10093
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:58,830
There

10094
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,220
are

10095
00:58:59,220 --> 00:58:59,550

biases

10098
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:00,630
too,

10099
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,750
of

10100
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,260
course,

10101
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:01,860
that

10102
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,010
we

10103
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:02,580
inherit,

10104
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:03,660
but

10105
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:04,770
it's

10106
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:04,980
in

10107
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,610
adolescence

10108
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:05,700

00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,390
puberty,

10110
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:06,780
that

10111
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,140
we go

10112
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,650
from

10113
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,430
essentially

10114
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:08,790
being

10115
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:09,300

10116
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,510
good

10117
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,690

of

10120
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:10,740
things,

10121
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:11,610
or

10122
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,660
somewhat

10123
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:12,930

things

10128
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:13,980
to be

10129
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:14,550
coming

10130
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,390
very

10131
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:15,600
good

10132
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:15,750
at a

10133
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,960
few

10134
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,260

10135
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:16,380
and

10136
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:16,680
very

10137
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:17,160
poor

10138
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,340

things.

10143
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:18,780
And

10144
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:18,990
that's

10145
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:19,350
because

10146
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:19,440
of

10147
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:19,500
the

10149
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:20,280

neuroplasticity.

10153
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:22,950
This

10154
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,430
ability

10155
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:23,520
to

10156
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:23,820
change

10157
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:23,910
the

10161
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:24,600

10163
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:25,260
is

10164
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:25,830
starting

10165
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:25,950
to

10166
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:26,340
taper

10167
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:26,700

10170
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:27,240
by

10171
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:27,420
our

10172
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:27,720
early

10173
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:28,410
20s,

10174
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:29,550
it's

10175
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:29,940
harder

10176
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,090

00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:30,660
achieve.

10178
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:31,650
Now,

10179
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:32,310
the

puberty.

10192
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:36,990
But

they

that

00:59:59,490 --> 00:59:59,580
they

10253
00:59:59,580 --> 00:59:59,820
have

10254
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:00,000
more

01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:03,420
In

01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,780
fact,

10263
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,020
you

10264
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:04,140
could

10265
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:04,500
argue

10266
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:04,680
that

10267
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,340
puberty

10268
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:05,880
is

10269
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:05,970
the

10270

10272
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:06,660
of

10273

maturation

10274
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:07,320
that

10275
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:07,440
you'll

10276
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:07,590
go

10277
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:07,890
through

10278

01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:08,250
any

10280
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:08,520

10281
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:08,610
in

10282
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:08,730
your

10283
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,180
life,

10284
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:09,540
it's

10285
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:09,630
the

10286
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:10,140
largest

01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:10,530
change

10288
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:10,650
that

10289
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:10,800
you'll

10290
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:10,980
go

10291
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:11,280
through

10292
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:11,460
at

10293
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:11,640
any

10294
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:11,880
point

10295
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:11,940
in

10296
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:12,030
your

10297
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:12,270
life

10298
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:12,360
in

10299
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:12,630
terms

10300
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:12,780
of

10301
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:13,170
who

10302
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:13,470
you

10303
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,040
are.

10304
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:14,970
Because

10305
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:15,090
your

10306
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:15,720
biology

10307
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:15,810
is

10308
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,320
fundamentally

10309
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:16,680
changed

10310
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:16,800
at

10311
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:16,890
the

10312
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,130
level

10313
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:17,220
of

10314
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:17,370
your

10315
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:17,850
brain,

10316
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:18,330
and

10317
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:18,600
your,

10318
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:18,900
your

10319
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,290
bodily

10320
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:19,920
organs,

10321
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:20,370
all

10322
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:20,550
your

10323
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:21,090
organs,

10324
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:21,630
from

10325
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:21,720
the

10326
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:22,050

10327
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:22,560
inward.

10328
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,270
So I

10329
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:24,480
want

10330
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:24,540
to

10331
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,050
visit

10332
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:25,290
a

10333
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:25,530
little

10334
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:25,680
bit

10335
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:25,770
of

10336
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:25,860
the

10337
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,490
research

10338
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,090
about

10339
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,720
some

10340
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:27,840
of

10341
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:27,930
the

10342
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:28,290
core

10343
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,010
needs

10344
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:29,550
that

10345
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:30,030
occurred

10346
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:30,270
during

10347
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:30,750
puberty

10348
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:30,840
and

10349
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,590
adolescence,

10350
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,400
not

10351
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:32,550
just

10352
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:32,670
for

10353
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,180
parents,

10354
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:33,270
or

10355
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,420
for

10356
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:33,510
the

10357
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,750
people

10358
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,870
that

10359
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:34,050
might

10360
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:34,620
be in

10361
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:35,190
puberty

10362
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:35,280
and

10363
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,030
adolescence,

10364
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:36,450
but

10365
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:37,110
also

10366
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:37,440
so

10367
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:37,560
that

10368
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:37,740
people

10369
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:37,920
can

10370
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,460
reflect

10371
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:38,670
on

10372
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:39,240
which

10373
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:39,630
of

10374
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:39,870
these

10375
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:40,080
sort

10376
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:40,290
of

10377
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,310
boxes

10378
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:41,430
were

10379
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:41,760
checked

10380
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:41,970
off

10381
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:42,120
for

10382
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,570
them

10383
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:43,140
as

10384
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:43,380
they

10385
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:43,980
approached,

10386
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:44,970
emotional

10387
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:45,480
matcher

10388
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,260
maturity.

10389
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,040
So

10390
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:47,310
there's

10391
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:47,460
a

10392
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,240
terrific

10393
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:48,660
review

10394
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,050
article

10395
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:49,200
that

10396
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,350
was

10397
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:49,740
published

10398
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:49,830
in

10399
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:49,920
the

10400

Nature,

10402
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,270
which

10403
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,630
is,

10404
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:52,560
if

10405
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:52,860
not

10406
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,070
the

premier,

10408
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:53,670
then

10409
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:53,970
certainly

10410
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:54,390
among

10411
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:54,750

10413
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:55,350

01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,050
During

01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,520
We

that.

10456
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:13,560
But I

10457
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:14,340
just

10458
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:14,490

I

10473
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:18,390
don't

10474
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,510
want

01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:18,630
to go

01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:19,620
right

10481
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,010
now,

10482
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:20,370
because

10483
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:20,460
you

10484
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:20,550
could

10485
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:20,640
do

they

10494
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:22,950

a lot

10497
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:24,630
of

10498
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,020
the

10505
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:27,810
For

10506
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:28,230
instance,

10507
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,320
I'll

10508
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:28,500
just

10509
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:28,830
highlight

10510
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:29,160
one,

10511
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:29,820
there's

10512
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,030
a

10513
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:30,780

10514
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,080
between

10521
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:32,940
and

10522
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,090
an

01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,510
area

10524
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,600

01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,170
that's

10528
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:34,710
involved

10529
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:35,130
in

dispersal

10534
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:38,400
is

10535
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:38,730
very

10536
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:39,240

01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:13,590
and

10619
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:13,680
in

10620
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:13,980
kids.

10621
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:14,460
There's

10622
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:14,670
it

10623
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:14,940
almost

10624
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,120
seems

10625
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:15,210
like

10626
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:15,390
there's

10627
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:15,480
a

10628
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:15,960
bias

10629
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,110
for

10630
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:16,740
action.

10631
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,010
And

10632
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:17,100
the

10633
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:17,460
action

10634
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:17,580
is

10635
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,000
always

10636
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,150
in

10637
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,210
the

10638
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:18,690
direction

10639
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,440
away

10640
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:19,770
from

10641
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:19,830
the

10642
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,250
primary

10643
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:20,820
caregiver.

10644
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,570
Now,

10645
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:21,870
as

10646
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,020
soon

10647
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,170
as I

10648
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:22,380
say

10649
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:22,770
that,

10650
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,100
I can

10651
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:23,280
just

10652
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,700
imagine

10653
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:23,850
in my

10654
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:24,150
mind

10655
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,270
that

10656
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:24,630
somebody

10657
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,810
out

10658
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:24,960
there

10659
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,170
saying,

10660
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:25,470
Well,

10661
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,040
no,

10662
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:26,250
my

10663
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:26,550
kid,

10664
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:26,640
as

10665
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:26,760
soon

10666
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:26,820
as

10667
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:26,940
they

10668
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,090
hit

10669
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:27,420
puberty,

10670
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,540
they

10671
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:27,720
just

10672
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:27,930
want

10673
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:27,990
to

10674
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,200
stay

10675
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:28,440
home

10676
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:28,590
with

10677
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:28,800
us

10678
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:28,980
all

10679
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,070
the

10680
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,400
time.

10681
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:29,940
That's

10682
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:30,210
not

10683
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:30,780
typical,

10684
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:30,990
it

10685
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:31,440
happens.

10686
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:31,560
But

10687
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:31,710
it's

10688
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:31,920
not

10689
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,400
typical.

10690
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,030
Mostly,

10691
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:33,270
there's

10692
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,330
a

10693
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:33,660
desire

10694
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:33,750
to

10695
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,020
start

10696
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:34,500
spending

10697
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:34,890
more

10698
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,160
time

10699
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:35,310
with

10700
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:35,730
friends,

10701
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:35,910
more

10702
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:36,180
time

10703
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:36,330
with

10704
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:36,630
peers

10705
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:36,780
and

10706
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:37,020
less

10707
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,380
time

10708
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:37,980
with

10709
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,060
adults.

10710
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,420
And I

10711
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:39,750
find

10712
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:39,840
it

10713
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,470
extremely

10714
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,890
interesting

10715
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:41,010
to

10716
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:41,220
note

10717
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:41,340
that

10718
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:41,610
that's

10719
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:41,880
not

10720
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:42,120
just

10721
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:42,270
true

10722
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:42,360
in

10723
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:42,750
humans,

10724
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:42,990
that's

10725
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,290
true

10726
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:43,560
in

10727
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:43,830
other

10728
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:44,190
primate

10729
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:44,760
species.

10730
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,270
That's

10731
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,540
true

10732
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:45,750
in

10733
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,320
rodents.

10734
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:46,560
That's

10735
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:46,710
true

10736
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,860
in

10737
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:47,370
almost

10738
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:47,700
every

10739
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,090
other

10740
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:48,900
mammalian

10741
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,560
species.

10742
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,610
So

10743
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:50,880
there's

10744
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,330
something

10745
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:51,630
about

10746
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:51,810
these

10747
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,320
hormones

10748
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:52,440
that

10749
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:52,680
don't

10750
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:52,980
just

10751
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,700
allow

10752
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,480
sexual

10753
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,230
reproduction.

10754
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:55,800
They

10755
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:55,980
don't

10756
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:56,130
just

10757
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:56,460
change

10758
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:56,550
the

10759
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:56,760
brain

10760
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:56,880
and

10761
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,300
bodily

10762
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:57,690
organs

10763
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:57,810
and

10764
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:57,870
the

10765
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:58,230
shape

10766
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,830
of of

10767
01:02:58,890 --> 01:02:59,310
us.

10768
01:02:59,580 --> 01:02:59,850
They

10769
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:00,570
also

10770
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,740
bias

10771
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:01,980
us

10772
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,370
towards

10773
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,090
dispersal

10774
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:03,360
getting

10775
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:03,750
further

10776
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,840
and

10777
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,170
further

10778
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:04,410
away

10779
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:04,590
from

10780
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,010
primary

10781
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:05,580
caregivers

10782
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:05,730
in

10783
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,270
particular.

10784
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:06,450
So

10785
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,080
parents

10786
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:07,320
of

10787
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:07,830
teenagers

10788
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:07,890
or

10789
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,190
future

10790
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:08,790
teenagers,

10791
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:09,330
it is

10792
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:09,630
not

10793
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:10,050
just

10794
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,830
normal,

10795
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,370
it is

10796
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:12,270
baked

10797
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:12,960
in to

10798
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,050
the

10799
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:13,710
biology

10800
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:13,800
of

10801
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,250
humans

10802
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:14,370
to

10803
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:15,180
disperse

10804
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:15,780
around

10805
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:16,530
adolescence

10806
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:16,860
and

10807
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,040
in

10808
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:17,100
the

10809
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:17,340
teen

10810
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:17,760
years.

10811
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:18,360
So

10812
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:18,600
again,

10813
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:18,660
I

10814
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:18,840
just

10815
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:18,960
want

10816
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:19,020
to

10817
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:19,410
highlight

10818
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:19,740
a few

10819
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:19,890
of

10820
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:20,370
these,

10821
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:20,940
what

10822
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,150
were

10823
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:21,780
listed

10824
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:22,470

10831
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,360
And

10832
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:27,780
puberty

10833
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:27,960

10834
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:28,170
very

10835
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:28,560
interesting

10836
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:28,920

10841
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:31,350

10846
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,330

10899
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:55,950
Last

10900
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:56,160

10901
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:56,460
I

10902
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:56,850
know,

10903
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:57,600
Dr.

10904
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,050
willrich

10905
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:58,350
quite

10906
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:58,740
well,

10907
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,010
she's

10908
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,430
done.

10909
01:03:59,460 --> 01:03:59,880
The

10910
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,240
work

10911
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:00,360
on

10912
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,080
dispersal

10913
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:01,590
is

10914
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,010
quite

10915
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:02,160
well

10916
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,460
known

10917
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:02,970
for

10918
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,150
that

10919
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:03,540
work.

10920
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:04,710
And

10921
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:05,670
it's

10922
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:05,730
a

10923
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:05,970
very

10924
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:06,420
extensive

10925
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:06,990
review.

10926
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:07,650
But I

10927
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:07,860
think

10928
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:07,980
you

10929
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:08,100
can

10930
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:08,310
find

10931
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:08,490
it,

10932
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,030
you'll

10933
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:09,270
find

10934
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,390
it

10935
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,080
accessible,

10936
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:10,590
lot

10937
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:10,680
of

10938
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,280
changes

10939
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:11,550
and

10940
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,000
thickness

10941
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:12,210
of

10942
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:12,360
the

10943
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:12,870
brain

10944
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,960
at

10945
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:13,230
different

10946
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:13,770
stages,

10947
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:14,190
etc.

10948
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:14,760
But I

10949
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:14,970
think

10950
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,150
most

10951
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:15,300
people

10952
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:15,390
will

10953
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:15,480
be

10954
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:15,840
interested

10955
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,080
in

10956
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:16,830
what

10957
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:17,010
that

10958
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:17,760
translates

10959
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,090
to,

10960
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:18,900
in

10961
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,140
the

10962
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:19,380
in

10963
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:19,470
the

10964
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:19,740
real

10965
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,220
world.

10966
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,090
And

10967
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,510
what's

10968
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:22,080
interesting

10969
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,350
is,

10970
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,070
during

10971
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:23,730
puberty,

10972
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,390
there's

10973
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:25,230
increased

10974
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:26,460
connection

10975
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,090
connectivity,

10976
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:27,270
as we

10977
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:27,540
call

10978
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:27,690
it,

10979
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,410
between

10980
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:28,500
the

10981
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:28,920
prefrontal

10982
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:29,370
cortex

10983
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:29,550
which

10984
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:29,670
is

10985
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,210
involved

10986
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:30,330
in

10987
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:30,900
motivation

10988
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,020
and

10989
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:31,410
decision

10990
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:31,890
making,

10991
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:32,460
being

10992
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:32,670
able

10993
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:32,820
to

10994
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,450
suppress

10995
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:34,020
action

10996
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:34,380
for

10997
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:34,830
making

10998
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:35,130
long

10999
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:35,610
term

11000
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,690
goals

11001
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,470
possible,

11002
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:38,310
as

11003
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:38,460
well

11004
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:38,580
as

11005
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:39,030
dopamine

11006
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:39,630
centers

11007
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,080
and

11008
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,200
the

11009
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:40,920
amygdala.

11010
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:41,370
So

11011
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:41,580
there's

11012
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:41,760
this

11013
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,210
really

11014
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:42,600
broad

11015
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,470
integration

11016
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:43,710
and

11017
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:44,520
testing.

11018
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:44,670
I

11019
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:44,880
think

11020
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,030
this

11021
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:45,120
is

11022
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,210
the

11023
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:45,630
key

11024
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:46,050
element

11025
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,200
here

11026
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:46,710
testing

11027
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,800
of

11028
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,370
circuits

11029
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,060
for

11030
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:48,690
emotions

11031
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:48,870
and

11032
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,410
reward

11033
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:49,590
as

11034
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:49,680
they

11035
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:49,980
relate

11036
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:50,070
to

11037
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:50,670
decisions.

11038
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,380
And I

11039
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:52,590
think

11040
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:52,770
that's

11041
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,190
useful

11042
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,490
because

11043
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:53,610
when

11044
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:53,700
you

11045
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:53,910
look

11046
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,970
at

11047
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:54,030
the

11048
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:54,450
behavior

11049
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:54,570
of

11050
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:55,170
adolescents

11051
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:55,290
and

11052
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:55,650
teens,

11053
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:55,950
they

11054
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:56,130
are

11055
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,580
testing

11056
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:56,970
social

11057
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:57,510
interactions.

11058
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:57,630
They

11059
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:57,720
are

11060
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,230
testing

11061
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:58,770
physical

11062
01:04:58,770 --> 01:04:59,370
interactions

11063
01:04:59,370 --> 01:04:59,550
with

11064
01:04:59,550 --> 01:04:59,640
the

11065
01:04:59,640 --> 01:04:59,970
world.

11066
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,080
Oftentimes,

11067
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,170
they're

11068
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,560
engaging

11069
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:01,680
in

11070
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,130
unsafe

11071
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:02,790
behavior.

11072
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:03,420
And

11073
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:04,470
you

11074
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,830
can't

11075
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:05,850
just

11076
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,300
I

11077
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:06,420
would

11078
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:06,600
never

11079
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:06,750
try

11080
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:06,840
and

11081
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,380
justify

11082
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:07,620
that

11083
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:07,890
with

11084
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:08,160
with

11085
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:08,250
the

11086
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:08,700
underlying

11087
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:09,390
neurology.

11088
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,080
But

11089
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,320
the

11090
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:10,890
neuroscience

11091
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,340
points

11092
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:11,730
to

11093
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:12,930
increased

11094
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:13,530
connectivity

11095
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:13,860
between

11096
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,190
areas

11097
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:14,250
of

11098
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:14,310
the

11099
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:14,700
brain

11100
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:15,180
that

11101
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:15,510
are

11102
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,810
related

11103
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:15,930
to

11104
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,860
emotionality

11105
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:17,310
and

11106
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:18,720
to

11107
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:18,990
threat

11108
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:19,470
detection,

11109
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:19,620
like

11110
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:19,680
the

11111
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,130
amygdala,

11112
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:20,280
but

11113
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:20,790
also

11114
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,450
reward.

11115
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:21,600
So

11116
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:21,720
it's

11117
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:21,780
a

11118
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,050
time

11119
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:22,200
of

11120
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:22,680
testing

11121
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,550
behaviorally,

11122
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:24,390
how

11123
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:24,750
different

11124
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:25,440
behaviors

11125
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:25,890
lead

11126
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,040
to

11127
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:26,490
success

11128
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:26,610
or

11129
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:27,000
not.

11130
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:27,780
It's

11131
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:28,260
how

11132
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:28,740
different

11133
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,160
behaviors

11134
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,400
lead

11135
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:29,490
to

11136
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:29,820
fear

11137
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:30,270
states

11138
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:30,480
or

11139
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:30,960
not.

11140
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:31,350
Now,

11141
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:31,410
of

11142
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:31,590
course,

11143
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:31,680
you

11144
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:31,800
could

11145
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:31,920
say

11146
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,070
that

11147
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:32,160
of

11148
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,370
any

11149
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:32,670
stage

11150
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:32,790
of

11151
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:33,240
development,

11152
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:33,360
but

11153
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:33,480
it

11154
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,750
seems

11155
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,900
like

11156
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:34,350
puberty

11157
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:34,710
is a

11158
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:35,070
is a

11159
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:35,640
very,

11160
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:35,850
very

11161
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:36,270
heightened

11162
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:36,690
stage

11163
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:36,870
in

11164
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:37,230
which

11165
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,920
testing

11166
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,220
of

11167
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,030
contingencies

11168
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:39,240
good

11169
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:39,390
or

11170
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:39,840
bad,

11171
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:40,410
is

11172
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:40,740
taking

11173
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:41,220
place.

11174
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:41,520
And

11175
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:41,580
of

11176
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:41,820
course,

11177
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:41,970
this

11178
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:42,120
is

11179
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,780
happening,

11180
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:43,020
it's

11181
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:43,530
operating

11182
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:43,740
in a

11183
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,160
body

11184
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:44,370
that's

11185
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:44,550
now

11186
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:44,820
more

11187
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:45,540
capable

11188
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:45,840
than

11189
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:45,990
the

11190
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,560
infant.

11191
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:47,100
So an

11192
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:47,460
infant

11193
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:47,700
can

11194
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,030
can

11195
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:48,450
damage

11196
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:48,990
themselves

11197
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,230
through

11198
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:49,800
error.

11199
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:50,520
But

11200
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:50,970
it's

11201
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:51,330
harder

11202
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:51,480
for

11203
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:51,690
them

11204
01:05:51,690 --> 01:05:51,840
to

11205
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,290
damage

11206
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:52,710
themselves

11207
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:52,890
through

11208
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:53,370
deliberate

11209
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:53,940
planning,

11210
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:54,150
you

11211
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,420
know,

11212
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,900
that's

11213
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:54,990
why

11214
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:55,110
it's

11215
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:55,440
important,

11216
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:55,500
of

11217
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:55,740
course,

11218
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:55,950
to

11219
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:56,400
lock

11220
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:56,550
up

11221
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:56,730
all

11222
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:56,820
the

11223
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,420
medications

11224
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:57,510
in

11225
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:57,570
the

11226
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:57,780
house,

11227
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:57,930
make

11228
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:58,110
sure

11229
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,530
infants

11230
01:05:58,530 --> 01:05:58,770
can

11231
01:05:58,770 --> 01:05:58,980
get

11232
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,070
to

11233
01:05:59,070 --> 01:05:59,340
them.

11234
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:00,000
But

11235
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:00,720
it's

11236
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,620
not

11237
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:01,980
likely

11238
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,190
that

11239
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:02,310
the

11240
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:02,700
infant

11241
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:02,790
is

11242
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:02,970
going

11243
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:03,090
to

11244
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:03,810
devise

11245
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:03,900
an

11246
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:04,680
extremely

11247
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,340
diabolical

11248
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:05,700
plan

11249
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:05,820
to

11250
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,120
get

11251
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,390
into

11252
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,510
the

11253
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:07,080
cabinet

11254
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:07,260
to

11255
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,650
get a

11256
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,040
certain

11257
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:08,790
substance,

11258
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:09,450
whereas

11259
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:09,540
a

11260
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,110
teenager

11261
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:10,620
might

11262
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:11,250
write.

11263
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:12,540
So

11264
01:06:12,870 --> 01:06:13,080
you

11265
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:13,200
can

11266
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,410
start

11267
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:13,500
to

11268
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:13,770
map

11269
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:13,860
the

11270
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,460
neurology

11271
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:14,850
onto

11272
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:15,030
some

11273
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:15,090
of

11274
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:15,300
this

11275
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:16,170
emotional

11276
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:16,980
exploration,

11277
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:17,250
I do

11278
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:17,610
realize

11279
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:17,730
that

11280
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:17,880
this

11281
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,180
episode

11282
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:18,270
is

11283
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:18,480
about

11284
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,080
emotions.

11285
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:19,620
puberty

11286
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:19,800
is a

11287
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,040
time

11288
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:20,160
in

11289
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,460
which

11290
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:21,300

11293
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:23,070

11294
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:23,640
the

11296
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:24,390
or

11297
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,540
the

animal

11299
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:25,170
is

11300
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:25,380
being

11301
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:26,160

11302
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:26,490
and

11303
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:26,940

11304
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:27,390
against

01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:29,880
now

11311
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:30,240
they

11312
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:30,480
are

01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:30,930

right?

11322
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:34,770
It's

11323
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:34,980

11324
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,310

11329
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,150
not

11330
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:36,240
the

food.

11340
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,450
Now,

01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:39,510
of

11342
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:39,660

01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:40,980
Yeah,

but

11350
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,220
I'm

they're

01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:42,540
doing.

11357
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:42,660
I'm

11358
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:42,870

11363
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:43,590
I'm

11364
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:43,800

11368
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,510
True.

11369
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,230
But

11370
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:46,620
the

11371
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,190
biology

11372
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,550
doesn't

11373
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,000
care

11374
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,300
about

11375
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:48,390

11377
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:49,260
the

child

11379
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,070

the

11382
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:51,480
is

11383
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:51,780
now

11384
01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:52,320
able,

11385
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:52,530
the

11386
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:52,860
teen

11387
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,250
really

11388
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:53,610
is

11389
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:53,970
able

11390
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:54,360
to

11391
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:54,810
now

11392
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,350
sample

11393
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:55,740
many,

11394
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,160
many

11395
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:56,670
more

11396
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,150

01:06:58,290 --> 01:06:58,560
through

11400
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,160
behavior.

11401
01:06:59,400 --> 01:06:59,610
So

11402
01:06:59,610 --> 01:06:59,790
some

11403
01:06:59,790 --> 01:06:59,850

01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,840
recommendations

11406
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:01,200
are

11407
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:01,800
interesting.

11408
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:01,980
The

11409
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:02,700
theory

11410
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,150
is

11411
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,510
that

11412
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,140
one

11413
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,230
of

11414
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,320
the

11415
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:04,890
motivations

11416
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,160
is to

11417
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,430
learn

11418
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,610
to

11419
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:06,210
mitigate

11420
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:06,300
the

11421
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:06,630
risk

11422
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:06,720
of

11423
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,140
famine

11424
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:07,260
and

11425
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,070
malnutrition.

11426
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,760
as

11427
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:09,390
teenagers

11428
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:09,570
get

11429
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:09,840
older,

11430
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:09,990
they

11431
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,350
start

11432
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:10,950
questioning

11433
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:11,160
whether

11434
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:11,190
or

11435
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,370
not

11436
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:11,520
their

11437
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,180
parents

11438
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:13,050
are

11439
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:13,470
everything

11440
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:13,590
they

11441
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:13,860
thought

11442
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:13,980
they

11443
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:14,250
were

11444
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:14,490
whether

11445
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:14,520
or

11446
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:14,640
not

11447
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:14,760
they're

11448
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:14,850
the

11449
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:15,180
greatest

11450
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:15,510
thing

11451
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:15,960
that

11452
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,170
ever

11453
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:16,620
was,

11454
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:17,250
or

11455
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:17,340
the

11456
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:17,580
worst

11457
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:17,730
thing

11458
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:17,850
that

11459
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,030
ever

11460
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,330
was,

11461
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,870
perhaps,

11462
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:20,940
including

11463
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:21,120
whether

11464
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,150
or

11465
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:21,300
not

11466
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:21,450
they

11467
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:21,660
will

11468
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:21,780
be

11469
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:21,960
able

11470
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,050
to

11471
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:22,470
provide

11472
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:22,650
them

11473
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,340
resources.

11474
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:23,490
So

11475
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:23,640
they

11476
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:23,970
test

11477
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:24,150
whether

11478
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,210
or

11479
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:24,420
not

11480
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:24,540
they

11481
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:24,690
can

11482
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,080
actually

11483
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:25,410
feed

11484
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,130
themselves

11485
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:26,340
whether

11486
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:26,400
or

11487
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:26,640
not

11488
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:26,820
they

11489
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:27,090
can

11490
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,630
support

11491
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,320
themselves,

11492
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:29,490
although

11493
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,060
rarely

11494
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,420
not.

11495
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:31,770
Certainly,

11496
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,100
it

11497
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,520
happens.

11498
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:32,640
But

11499
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,000
rarely

11500
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,150
Are

11501
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:33,450
they

11502
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,290
really

11503
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:34,650
taking

11504
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:34,830
care

11505
01:07:34,830 --> 01:07:34,890
of

11506
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:35,370
themselves,

11507
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:35,580
although

11508
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:35,910
some

11509
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:36,180
teens

11510
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:36,330
are

11511
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:36,630
forced

11512
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,690
to

11513
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:36,840
take

11514
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:36,990
care

11515
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:37,080
of

11516
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:37,530
themselves,

11517
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:37,620
of

11518
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,040
course,

11519
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,610
because

11520
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:39,090
parents

11521
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:39,270
and

11522
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:39,450
other

11523
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:39,960
caretakers

11524
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,110
aren't

11525
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:40,650
available.

11526
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:41,640
The

11528
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,080

11529
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:43,500
map

11530
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:43,620
to

11534
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,180
later,

11535
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:45,600
there's

11536
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:45,720
been

11537
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:45,930
a big

11542
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:47,430

11545
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:48,330

This

11627
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:21,690
And

11628
01:08:21,690 --> 01:08:22,050
yet,

11629
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,040
really,

01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:23,670
is

11633
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:23,970
during

11634
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:24,450
puberty

11635
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:24,630
to

11636
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:25,200
encourage

11637
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:25,350
as

11638
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:25,770
many

11639
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,190
they

11640
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:26,760
say

11641
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,390
forms

11642
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:27,540
of

11643
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,230
interaction

11644
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:28,380
that

11645
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:28,740
allow

11646
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,280
children,

11647
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:30,330
teens,

11648
01:08:30,330 --> 01:08:30,750
really

11649
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,260
an

11650
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,040
adolescence,

11651
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:32,310
I

11652
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:32,490
keep

11653
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:32,700
calling

11654
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:32,820
them

11655
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:33,210
children,

11656
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:33,300
but

11657
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:33,420
what

11658
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:33,480
I

11659
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:33,690
mean

11660
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:33,840
are

11661
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,260
people,

11662
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:35,070
children

11663
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,250
going

11664
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:35,400
through

11665
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:35,850
puberty

11666
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:36,570
that

11667
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,140
allow

11668
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:37,320
them

11669
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:37,440
to

11670
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:37,800
test

11671
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,040
this

11672
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:38,250
thing

11673
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:38,370
of

11674
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,150
autonomy,

11675
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:39,750
so

11676
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:39,900
that

11677
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,020
they

11678
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,230
can

11679
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:40,650
start

11680
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:41,040
to

11681
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:41,970
make

11682
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:42,720
good

11683
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,410
assessments

11684
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,160
about

11685
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,060
their

11686
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:45,570
extra

11687
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:45,990
receptive

11688
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,350
events

11689
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:46,530
that

11690
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:46,740
they

11691
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:46,860
are

11692
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:47,700
selecting,

11693
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:48,030
and

11694
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:48,210
how

11695
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:48,390
those

11696
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,600
make

11697
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:48,720
them

11698
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:48,960
feel

11699
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:49,470
internally.

11700
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:49,620
So

11701
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:49,770
they're

11702
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:50,130
essentially

11703
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:50,400
doing

11704
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:50,460
a

11705
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,210
buffet,

11706
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:51,420
the

11707
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:51,810
buffet

11708
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:51,990
has

11709
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,200
now

11710
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:52,830
broadened

11711
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,160
to

11712
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,430
not

11713
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:53,700
just

11714
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,240
include

11715
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:54,600
the

11716
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,260
events

11717
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:55,500
and

11718
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,280
experiences

11719
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:56,490
that

11720
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:56,640
their

11721
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,030
parents

11722
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,120
and

11723
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:57,300
other

11724
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:57,870
caretakers

11725
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:58,110
bring

11726
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,350
them.

11727
01:08:58,530 --> 01:08:58,920
But

11728
01:08:59,040 --> 01:08:59,220
they

11729
01:08:59,220 --> 01:08:59,430
can

11730
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,700
now

11731
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,090
expand

11732
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:00,150
the

11733
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:00,540
buffet

11734
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:00,750
into

11735
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:01,110
things

11736
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,380
that

11737
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:01,860
they

11738
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:02,040
can

11739
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:02,430
provide

11740
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,090
themselves.

11741
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,270
And

11742
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:03,690
so

11743
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:04,980
adolescence,

11744
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:05,160
and

11745
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:05,760
puberty

11746
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:06,090
is

11747
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:06,420
really

11748
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:06,840
seen

11749
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:06,990
as

11750
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:07,080
the

11751
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,380
period

11752
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:07,470
of

11753
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:08,040
development

11754
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:08,460
in

11755
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:08,730
which

11756
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:09,000
one

11757
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:09,450
self

11758
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,290
samples

11759
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:10,710
for

11760
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:10,950
these

11761
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:11,130
two

11762
01:09:11,130 --> 01:09:11,550
elements

11763
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:11,670
that

11764
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:11,760
we

11765
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,030
talked

11766
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:12,210
about

11767
01:09:12,210 --> 01:09:12,270
at

11768
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:12,360
the

11769
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:12,840
beginning,

11770
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:13,260
which

11771
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:13,560
are,

11772
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:14,340
how

11773
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:14,880
do I

11774
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,630
form

11775
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:16,290
bonds?

11776
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:16,530
And

11777
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:16,710
how

11778
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:16,890
do I

11779
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:17,100
make

11780
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,850
predictions

11781
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:18,210
about

11782
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:18,390
what

11783
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:18,510
will

11784
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:18,690
make

11785
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:18,840
me

11786
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,170
feel

11787
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:19,590
good?

11788
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:20,760
at a

11789
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:21,060
level

11790
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:21,150
of

11791
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,050
interoception.

11792
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:22,830
Some

11793
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:22,920
of

11794
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,040
that

11795
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,250
might

11796
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:23,550
sound

11797
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:23,640
a

11798
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:23,850
little

11799
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:24,810
transactional,

11800
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:25,320
you

11801
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:25,530
know

11802
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:25,770
that

11803
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,010
all

11804
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,130
we're

11805
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:26,370
trying

11806
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:26,580
to do

11807
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:26,760
is

11808
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,150
figure

11809
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:27,450
out

11810
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:27,720
how

11811
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:27,870
we

11812
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:28,260
can

11813
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,010
bond

11814
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:29,160
with

11815
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:29,430
people

11816
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,610
so we

11817
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:29,790
can

11818
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:30,030
get

11819
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:30,210
what

11820
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:30,360
we

11821
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:30,660
need

11822
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:30,870
so we

11823
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:31,020
can

11824
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,320
feel

11825
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:31,500
how

11826
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:31,650
we

11827
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:32,010
need.

11828
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:32,910
I

11829
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:33,120
think

11830
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:33,360
that's

11831
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:33,570
true

11832
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:33,690
to

11833
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:33,900
some

11834
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:34,320

11943
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:17,220
So I

11958
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,030
Because

01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:21,360

11973
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:27,330
that's

11974
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:27,390

And

this

12108
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:20,340
There's

particularly

12118
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:24,870

at

01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,760
UCLA,

12126
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:27,030
he

12127
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,360

most

12131
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:28,470
of

01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,740
our

12136
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:30,030

01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:30,840
relationships

12138
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:31,620
is

12139
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:31,740
the

01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,340

dopaminergic.

12147
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,310
So

01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:35,670

12151
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:36,510
or

12152
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,290
serotonergic,

12153
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,530

12157
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:39,780
And

12158
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:39,930
this

12159
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:40,260

12160
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:40,440

Father,

12168
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:43,290

01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:45,510
just

01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:50,730
the

12346
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:52,800
happens

12347
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:52,890
to

01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:53,190
be,

12349
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,700

12351
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:54,090
as

12352
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:54,750

12353
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:54,870

12354
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,110
things

12355
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:55,260
that

12356
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:55,350
are

12357
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,070
exciting.

12358
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,340
So it

12359
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:56,490
could

12360
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:56,610
be

12362
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:57,150
it

12363
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:57,270
could

12364
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:57,360
be

12365
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:57,840

12366
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:57,930
it

12367
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:58,050
could

12368
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:58,410
be

12369
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,340
summer

12370
01:12:59,340 --> 01:12:59,850

12371
01:12:59,850 --> 01:12:59,940
it

12372
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:00,090
could

12373
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:00,300
be

12374
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:00,720
the

12375
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,050
next

01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:01,260

12377
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:01,680
thing.

12378
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:01,890
And

12379
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:02,040
so

12380
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:02,220
this

12381
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:02,400
kind

12382
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:02,460

12384
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:03,210

12385
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:03,300

12386
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:03,600
forth

12387
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:03,870

systems

12392
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,060
seems

12393
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:06,510
to be

12394
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:07,710
the

12395
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:08,400
basis

12396
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:08,640
from

12397
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:08,880

12398
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,360
healthy

12399

12402
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:10,800
created.

12403
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,040
And I

12404
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:11,400
invite

12405
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:11,730
anyone

12406
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:11,910
who's

12407
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:12,210
interested

12408
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:12,270
in

12409
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:12,480
this

12410
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:12,780
to

12411
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:13,620
look

12412
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:13,740
up

12413
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:13,950
some

12414
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:14,220

12415
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:15,150
Dr.

12416
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,510
shores

12417
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,990
work.

12418
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:17,280
I

12419
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:17,490
think

12420
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:17,520
I

12421
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:17,970
misspoke

12422
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:18,060
on

12423
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:18,120
the

12424
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:18,330
last

12425
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:18,660
episode.

12426
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:18,780
He's

12427
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:18,990
not a

12428
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,590
psychiatrist.

12429
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,740
He's

12430
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:19,800
a

12431
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,310
clinical

12432
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,060
psychologist

12433
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:21,180
and

12434
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:21,960
psychoanalyst,

12435
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:22,470
but

12436
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,710
has

12437
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:22,950
deep

12438
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:23,310
routings

12439
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:23,430
in

12440
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:24,180
neuroscience.

12441
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:24,360
So

12442
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:24,450
it's,

12443
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:24,780
I

12444
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,020

01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:25,050
a

01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:27,390
But

12449
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:27,720
the

way

12451
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:27,990
it's

12452
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:28,500
framed

12453
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:28,890

And

12648
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,310
and

12649
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,430
you

12650
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:38,580
were

12651
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:39,120
forced

12652
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:39,180
to

12653
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:39,480

12656
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:41,670
chances

12657
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:42,090
are,

12658
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:42,960
this

12659
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,080

12660
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:43,380
still

01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:43,830
true

12662
01:14:43,890 --> 01:14:44,310

01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:44,430
of

12664
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:44,670

12668
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:46,410
down

12669
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:46,500

12670
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:46,560
the

12671
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:46,950
brain.

12672
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,000
For

12673
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,360
left

12674
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:48,750
handers,

12675
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,200
people

12676
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:49,590
that

12677
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:49,950
people

12678
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:50,070
that

12679
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,790
naturally

12680
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:51,090
write

01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:51,330
their

12685
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:51,990
and

12686
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:52,440
always

12687
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:52,860
did,

12688
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:54,240
language

12689
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:54,450
is

12690
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:54,840
still

12691
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,410
mostly

12692
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:55,530
in

12693
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:55,590
the

12694
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:55,920

12696
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,370
of

01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:56,430
the

01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:56,880
brain.

12699
01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:58,050
But

12700
01:14:58,950 --> 01:14:59,370
it's

12701
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,790
also

12702
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:00,000
found

12703
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,540
More

12704
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,140
often

12705
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:01,560
in

12706
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:01,740
the

12707
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:01,980
right

12708
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:02,190
side

12709
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:02,250
of

12710
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:02,310
the

12711
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:02,490
brain,

12712
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:02,670
so

12713
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:02,910
it's

12714
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:03,390
not

12715
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:03,630
as

12716
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:04,380
lateralized.

12717
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:04,590
As we

12718
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:04,800
say

12719
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:04,950
it's

12720
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,100
kind

12721
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:05,160
of

12722
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:05,700
distributed

12723
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:06,030
between

12724
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:06,420
both.

12725
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:06,840
Okay,

12726
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,140
so

12727
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:07,440
right

12728
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,010
handers,

12729
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:08,460
most

12730
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:08,520
of

12731
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:08,610
your

01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:08,880
language

12733
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:08,940
is

12734
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,180
coming

12735
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:09,330
from

12736
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:09,390
the

12737
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:09,570

12739
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:09,780

12740
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:09,870
your

12741
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:10,200
brain.

12742
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:11,280
left

12743
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:11,700
handers,

12744
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:11,850
it's

12745
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,150
probably

12746
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:12,210
a

12747
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:12,420
little

12748
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:12,510
bit

12749
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:12,690
more

12750
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,080
evenly

12751
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:13,710
distributed.

12752
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:14,160
And

12753
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:14,340
there

12754
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:14,430
are

12755
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:14,580
some

12756
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,090
variations,

12757
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:15,240
whether

12758
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:15,270
or

12759
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:15,390
not

12760
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:15,540
you're

12761
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:15,600
a

12762
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:15,870
hook,

12763
01:15:15,870 --> 01:15:16,380
righty,

12764
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:16,800
or a

12765
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,070
hook,

12766
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:17,670
lefty.

12767
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:17,970
There's

12768
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:18,090
all

12769
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:18,330
sorts

12770
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:18,450
of

12771
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:18,900
nuance

12772
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,020
to

12773
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:19,260
this.

12774
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:19,410
But

12775
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:19,650
that's

12776
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:19,980
the

12777
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:20,520
general

12778
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:21,390
aspect.

12779
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,230
So

12780
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:22,680
language

12781
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:22,920
tends

12782
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,070
to be

12783
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:23,460
centered

12784
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,000
in

12785
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:24,090

12786
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:24,330

12787
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:24,510

12788
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:24,570
of

12789
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:24,630
the

12790
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,930
brain.

12791
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:25,260
And

12792
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:25,440
that

12793
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:25,890
includes

12794
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:26,490

12795
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:26,910
grammar,

12796
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,720
syntax,

12797
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,050
all

12798
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:28,170

12799
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:28,350
it,

12800
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:29,130
except

12801
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:29,280
for

12802
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:29,730
one.

12803
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:29,940
And

12804
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:30,030
we'll

12805
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:30,210
talk

12806
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:30,360
about

12807
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:30,540
one

12808
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:30,900
aspect

12809
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:30,990
of

12810
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:31,470
language

12811
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:31,680
that

12812
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:32,160
seems

12813
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:32,430
to be

12814
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:32,700
more

12815
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,270
right

12816
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,810
brain,

12817
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,110
that's

12818
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:34,410
very

12819
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,040
interesting.

12820
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:36,240
There

12821
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:36,630
does

12822
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:36,870
seem

12823
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,290
to be

12824
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:38,130
some

12825
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,910
arithmetic

12826
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,690
advantage.

12827
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:40,290
So

12828
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:40,680
ability

12829
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:40,770
in

12830
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:41,190
math

12831
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:41,880
in

12832
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:41,970
the

12833
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:42,360

12834
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:42,720

12835
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:42,810
of

12836
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:42,870
the

12837
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:43,260
brain,

12838
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:43,770
and

12839
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:43,860
I'm

12840
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:43,980
going

12841
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:44,040
to

12842
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:44,250
talk

12843
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:44,400
about

12844
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:44,520
how

12845
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:44,640
all

12846
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:44,790
this

12847
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,940
was

12848
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,360
discovered

12849
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:45,510
in a

12850
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,810
minute.

12851
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,040
And

12852
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,100
the

12853
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:47,340
right

12854
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:47,790
brain,

12855
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:49,110
however,

12856
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,320
is

12857
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,280
linguistically

12858
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,000
primitive.

12859
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,240
Most

12860
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:51,450
people

12861
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:51,600
don't

12862
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:51,930
realize

12863
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:52,050
this,

12864
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:52,260
because

12865
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:52,350
the

12866
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:52,590
right

12867
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:52,800
brain

12868
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:52,890
is

12869
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:53,130
always

12870
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:53,670
described

12871
01:15:53,670 --> 01:15:53,790
as

12872
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:53,910
the

12873
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:54,390
emotive

12874
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,780
side.

12875
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:54,900
It's

12876
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:55,140
super

12877
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,830
emotional

12878
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,950
and

12879
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:56,670
holistic.

12880
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:57,210
But

12881
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:57,540
it's

12882
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:57,840
actually

12883
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,620
linguistically

12884
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,160
primitive.

12885
01:15:59,160 --> 01:15:59,280
And

12886
01:15:59,280 --> 01:15:59,430
there's

12887
01:15:59,430 --> 01:15:59,610
a way

12888
01:15:59,610 --> 01:15:59,760
that

12889
01:15:59,760 --> 01:15:59,910
that

12890
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:00,120
that's

12891
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:00,270
been

12892
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:00,630
teased

12893
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:00,990
out,

12894
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,860
through

12895
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:02,580
experiment.

12896
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,480
It's

12897
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:03,960
very

12898
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,470
good

12899
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:04,680
at

12900
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,550
manipulating

12901
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,240
spatial

12902
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:06,660
things

12903
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:06,810
and

12904
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:07,260
visual

12905
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:07,980
spatial

12906
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:08,910
tasks.

12907
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:09,270
It's

12908
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,810
primarily

12909
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:10,200
handling

12910
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:10,410
that

12911
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:10,830
stuff.

12912
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,130
But

12913
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:11,220
it's

12914
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:11,430
sort

12915
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,550
of

12916
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,030
non

12917
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:12,750
language,

12918
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:13,500
except

12919
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:13,860
one

12920
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:14,520
aspect.

12921
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,210
And

12922
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:15,330
there

12923
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:15,540
isn't

12924
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:15,870
a ton

12925
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:16,020
of

12926
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:16,380
evidence

12927
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:16,470
for

12928
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,620
this,

12929
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:16,740
but

12930
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:16,830
the

12931
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:17,220
evidence

12932
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:17,310
is

12933
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:17,670
strong,

12934
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:17,880
which

12935
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,120
is

12936
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,050
prosody.

12937
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,370
prosody

12938
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:21,300
is

12939
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:21,420
the

12940
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,110
lilting

12941
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:22,230
and

12942
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:22,950
falling

12943
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:23,160
of

12944
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:23,820
language.

12945
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:25,590
So a

12946
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,770
good

12947
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:26,190
example

12948
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:26,280
would

12949
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:26,400
be

12950
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:26,940
Italian,

12951
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:27,060
I

12952
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,270
don't

12953
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:27,510
speak

12954
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:27,870
Italian.

12955
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:27,930
I

12956
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:28,140
only

12957
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,260
know

12958
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:28,320
a

12959
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:28,560
little

12960
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:28,710
bit

12961
01:16:28,710 --> 01:16:28,770
of

12962
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:29,310
Italian.

12963
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:29,970
But

12964
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,180
they

12965
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:30,480
must

12966
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:30,540
be

12967
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:30,930
Italian

12968
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:31,020
I

12969
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,290
know

12970
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:31,530
is

12971
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,430
when

12972
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:32,910
my

12973
01:16:32,910 --> 01:16:33,360
Italian

12974
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:33,780
colleagues

12975
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:33,870
have

12976
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,050
said

12977
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:34,290
to me

12978
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,440
my

12979
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:34,770
cousin

12980
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:35,160
Ichi,

12981
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:35,340
which

12982
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:35,550
means

12983
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:35,730
like,

12984
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:35,910
What

12985
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:35,940
are

12986
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:36,030
you

12987
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:36,360
trying

12988
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:36,420
to

12989
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:36,570
say?

12990
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:36,630
or

12991
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,780
What

12992
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:36,810
are

12993
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:36,930
you

12994
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:37,320
saying,

12995
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:37,950
I

12996
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:38,130
think

12997
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:38,250
I'm

12998
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:38,460
getting

12999
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:38,610
that

13000
01:16:38,610 --> 01:16:38,910
right.

13001
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:39,420
Basically,

13002
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:39,540
they're

13003
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:39,750
saying

13004
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,810
I

13005
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:39,990
don't

13006
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,200
speak

13007
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,560
Italian,

13008
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:40,740
which

13009
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:40,890
is

13010
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:41,220
true,

13011
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:41,940
or

13012
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:42,570
because

13013
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:42,750
one

13014
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:42,810
of

13015
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:42,960
them

13016
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,290
knows

13017
01:16:43,290 --> 01:16:43,380
and

13018
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:43,590
loves

13019
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,070
Costello

13020
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,310
very

13021
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:44,700
much.

13022
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:45,660
They

13023
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:45,870
always

13024
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:46,080
say

13025
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:46,440
mp

13026
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,070
grani,

13027
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:47,730
which

13028
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:48,120
means

13029
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:48,450
big

13030
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:48,840
lazy

13031
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,230
guy,

13032
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:49,470
which

13033
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:50,010
accurately

13034
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:50,550
captures

13035
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,210
Costello.

13036
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:51,960
So

13037
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:52,920
even

13038
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:53,100
those

13039
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:53,280
few

13040
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,120
examples,

13041
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:54,600
right,

13042
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:54,930
Miko

13043
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:55,140
said

13044
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,680
he

13045
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:56,430
won't

13046
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:56,520
be

13047
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:56,670
good

13048
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:56,970
on

13049
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,120
it.

13050
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:57,690
There's

13051
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:58,050
a lot

13052
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:58,140

01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,470
lilt

13054
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,590
and

13055
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,130
fall

13056
01:16:59,190 --> 01:16:59,370
in

13057
01:16:59,370 --> 01:16:59,940
Italian

13058
01:16:59,970 --> 01:17:00,210
other

13059
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:00,630
languages

13060
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:00,810
not

13061
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:00,930
so

13062
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:01,200
much.

13063
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:01,320
And

13064
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:01,380
it

13065
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:01,740
varies

13066
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:01,860
by

13067
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:02,460
language.

13068
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:02,670
One

13069
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:02,730
of

13070
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:02,790
the

13071
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,060
reasons

13072
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:03,180
I

13073
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,420

13074
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:03,810
Italian,

13075

so

13076
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:04,530
beautiful,

13077
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:04,830
not

13078
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:04,920
the

13079
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:05,280
Italian

speak,

13082
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:05,790
but

13083
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:05,850
the

13084
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:06,180
Italian

13085
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:06,390

13086
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:06,720
other

13087
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:06,960

01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,380
speak,

13089
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:07,890
so

13090
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:08,280
beautiful

13091
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:08,400
to

13092
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:08,670
listen

13093
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:08,970
to is

13094
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:09,300
that

13095
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:09,660

13096
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,230
prosody,

13097
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:10,380
and

13098
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:10,650
the

13099
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:11,040
shifts

13100
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:11,160
in

13101
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:11,880
intonation

13102
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:12,330

13103
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:12,750
really

13104
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,350
quite

13105
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,010
remarkable.

13106
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:14,130
It's

13107
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:14,400
almost

13108
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:14,670
like

13109
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:14,790
a

13110
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:15,150

13111
01:17:15,150 --> 01:17:15,690
song,

13112
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,320

speak.

13116
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,520
And I

13117
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,640
used

13118
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:17,730
to

13119
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:17,880
like

13120
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:18,090
to go

13121
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:18,180

01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:18,660
scientific

13123
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,020
meetings.

13124
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:19,320
And I

13125
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,680

13126
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:19,830
hang

13127
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,950

13128
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:20,040
with

13129
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,130
the

13130
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:20,700
Italians

13131
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:20,850
because

13132
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,000
I had

13133
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:21,120

labs.

13139
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:22,860
But

13140
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,040
also

13141
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,190
because

13142
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:23,280
they

13143
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:23,430

13152
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:25,230

01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:26,580
incredible.

13156
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:26,760
They

13157
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:26,880
would

13158
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,150
rather

13159
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:27,690
starve

13160
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:27,900

13167
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:30,060
they

13168
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:30,210

01:17:30,930 --> 01:17:31,050
they're

13173
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:31,260

fantastic.

13179
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:33,480
But

13180
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:33,780

13205
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,780
So in

13206
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:39,960
any

13207
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:40,320

13208
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:40,560
the

13209
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:40,890
right

13210
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:41,220
brain

13211
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:41,400
is

13212
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:41,730

13213
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:42,210
things

13214
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:42,510

manipulating

13219
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,190
spatial

13221
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,540
And

13222
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:45,780
I'll

13223
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:45,960
talk

13224
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:46,110
about

13225
01:17:46,110 --> 01:17:46,230
this

13226
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:46,410
more

01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:46,860
future

13229
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,370
episode.

13230
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:47,610
But

13231
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:48,840
this

13232
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:48,990

13235
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,130
Split

13236
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:50,400

13240
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:51,150
that

13241
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:51,540
lack

13242
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:52,080

13243
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:52,350
between

13244
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:52,440
the

13245
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:52,560
two

13246
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:52,890
sides

13247
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:52,950
of

13248
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,040
the

13249
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:53,460
brain.

13250
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,180
And

13251
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:54,390
it

13252
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:54,720

13338
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:22,290
And

01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:22,620
there's

13340
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,010

01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:27,750
But

We

01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,420
We're

lifting

13639
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:31,410
but

when

13722
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,060

01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,200
my

13726
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:07,620
opinion

13727
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:07,950
is

13728
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,090
that,

13729
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:10,200
indeed,

13730
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:11,070
there

13731
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:11,280
are

13732
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:11,730
neurons

13733
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:11,820
in

13734
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:11,910
the

13735
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,390
brain

13736
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:12,840
that

13737
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:13,380
clearly

13738
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:13,920
represent

13739
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,040

13740
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:14,580

01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:14,700
of

13742
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:15,150
others.

13743
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:15,600
But

13744
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:15,750
it's

13745
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,930
not

13746
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,170
clear

13747
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:16,290
that

13748
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:16,440
they're

13749
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:16,830
wired

13750
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,040
into

13751
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:17,160
the

13752
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,610
emotion

13753
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:17,700
and

13754
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:18,120
empathy

13755
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,480
system

13756
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:18,600
in

13757
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:18,780
any

13758
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:19,170
direct

13759
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:19,470
way.

13760
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:20,100
And I

13761
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:20,280
think

13762
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:20,370
the

13763
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:20,640
growing

13764
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,210
consensus

13765
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:21,450
is

13766
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:21,720
that

13767
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,230
mirror

13768
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,650
neurons,

13769
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:22,800
while

13770
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:22,890
the

13771
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:23,190
name

13772
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:23,340
is

13773
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,090
terrific,

13774
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,860
is so

13775
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,520
catchy,

13776
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:27,360
and

13777
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:27,840
encompasses

13778
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,020
so

13779
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:28,320
much

13780
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:28,380
of

13781
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:28,500
what

13782
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:28,590
you

13783
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:28,680
would

13784
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:28,980
love

13785
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,130
for

13786
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:29,340
it to

13787
01:21:29,340 --> 01:21:29,910
encompass,

13788
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:30,150
but

13789
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:30,270
that

13790
01:21:30,270 --> 01:21:30,360
the

13791
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:30,780
data

13792
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:31,170
don't

13793
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:31,440
really

13794
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:31,860
support

13795
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,100
that.

13796
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,250
But

13797
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:32,400
this

13798
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:32,520
is

13799
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,120
controversial.

13800
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,210
And

13801
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:33,300
I'm

13802
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:33,660
perfectly

13803
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,050
happy

13804
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:34,350

01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:35,130

that

13810
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:36,240

13811
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:36,600
debate

13812
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:36,810
it

13813
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:37,560
better

13814
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:37,710

There

01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:39,360

01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:40,050
however,

won't.

13921
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:20,220
Or

13922
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:20,310
you

01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:20,580
can,

01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:20,910
you

there

13930
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:22,770
are

01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,250

01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,840
solve

13937
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:24,930
the

13939
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:25,350
called

13940
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,890
Prisoner's

Dilemma

13942
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,940
by

13943
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:27,420
looking

13944
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:27,540
at

13945
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:27,960
previous

01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:28,440
behavior

13947
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:28,590
and

13948
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:29,130
making

13949
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:29,940
predictions

13950
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:30,420
about

13951
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:30,900
the

13952
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,530
likely

13953
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:31,890
next

13954
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:32,520
behavior

13955
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:33,210
that

13956
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,600
the

13957
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,020
other

13958
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,680
individual

13959
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:34,830
will

13960
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,280
engage

13961
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:35,490
in.

13962
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:35,820
And

13963
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:35,940
there

13964
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,090
do

13965
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:36,300
seem

13966
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:36,480
to be

13967
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:36,960
neurons

13968
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,140
that

13969
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:37,200
are

13970
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:37,440
doing

13971
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,650
these

13972
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:38,040
sorts

13973
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:38,250
of

13974
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,450
predictions

13975
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:39,540
or

13976
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,470
computations.

13977
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,070
And,

13978
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,910
again,

13979
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:42,420
I'll

13980
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:42,780
go

13981
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:43,020
into

13982
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:43,170
this

13983
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:43,260
in

13984
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:43,410
more

13985
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:43,770
detail

13986
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:43,860
in

13987
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:43,920
the

13988
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,400
future.

13989
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,000
So

13990
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:45,360
rather

13991
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:45,450
than

13992
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:45,570
think

13993
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:45,780
about

13994
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,140
mirror

13995
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,500
neurons,

13996
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:46,620
like

13997
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,130
neurons

13998
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:47,310
for

13999
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:47,880
empathy,

14000
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:48,330
I

14001
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:48,630
think

14002
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:48,810
it's

14003
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:49,290
more

14004
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,400
correct

14005
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:50,790
to

14006
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,120
think

14007
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:51,450
about

14008
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:51,930
neurons

14009
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,050
that

14010
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:52,110
are

14011
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:52,350
trying

14012
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:52,470
to

14013
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:52,950
predict

14014
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:53,040
the

14015
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,520
behavior

14016
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:53,640
of

14017
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,210
others.

14018
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:54,420
And

14019
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:54,720
that's,

14020
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,110
as we

14021
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,440
said,

14022
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:55,590
one

14023
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:55,680
of

14024
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:55,740
the

14025
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:56,040
core

14026
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:56,760
features

14027
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,450
of

14028
01:22:58,200 --> 01:22:58,800
emotions

14029
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,010
which

14030
01:22:59,010 --> 01:22:59,220
are

14031
01:22:59,220 --> 01:22:59,400
to

14032
01:22:59,400 --> 01:22:59,640
make

14033
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:00,270
to

14034
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:00,720
establish

14035
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,380
bonds

14036
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:01,590
and

14037
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:01,890
through

14038
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,130
those

14039
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:02,460
bonds

14040
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:02,670
to be

14041
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:02,820
able

14042
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:02,940
to

14043
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:03,300
predict

14044
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:03,870
behavior.

14045
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,200
So

14046
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,040
oxytocin

14047
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,160
is

14048
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:05,400
one

14049
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:06,180
component

14050
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:06,300
of

14051
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:06,480
this

14052
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:07,260
ability

14053
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,040
to

14054
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:08,880
predict

14055
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:09,690
others

14056
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:10,170
behavior

14057
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:10,290
and

14058
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:10,350
to

14059
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:10,680
guide

14060
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:10,800
our

14061
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,010
own

14062
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:11,430
behavior.

14063
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,670
So

14064
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:11,880
here

14065
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:11,910
are

14066
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:12,330
some

14067
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:13,890
experiments

14068
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:14,160
that

14069
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:14,550
involve

14070
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,640
the

14071
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:15,360
administration

14072
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,570
of

14073
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:16,620
intranasal

14074
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,430
oxytocin.

14075
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:17,640
This

14076
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:17,760
is

14077
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,120
actually

14078
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:18,780
people

14079
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,320
now I

14080
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:19,500
think

14081
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:19,590
you

14082
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,740
need

14083
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:19,770
a

14084
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:20,430
prescription,

14085
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:20,670
although

14086
01:23:20,670 --> 01:23:20,760
in

14087
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:20,880
some

14088
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:21,210
places

14089
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:21,300
you

14090
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:21,600
don't,

14091
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:21,840
there

14092
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:21,870
are

14093
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,110
people

14094
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:22,260
who

14095
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:22,350
are

14096
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:22,920
taking

14097
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:23,700
intranasal

14098
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,450
oxytocin

14099
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:24,600
in

14100
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:24,810
order

14101
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:24,930
to

14102
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:25,110
try

14103
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,200
and

14104
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:25,770
increase

14105
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:25,890
the

14106
01:23:25,890 --> 01:23:26,250
depth

14107
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:26,340
of

14108
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:26,910
bonding.

14109
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,770
And I

14110
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:28,980
don't

14111
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:29,280
recommend

14112
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:29,370
you

14113
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:29,490
do

14114
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:29,580
that.

14115
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:29,730
I've

14116
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:30,090
never

14117
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:30,450
tried

14118
01:23:30,450 --> 01:23:30,780
that

14119
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:30,960
I

14120
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:31,350
whatever

14121
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,950
oxytocin

14122
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:32,100
I've

14123
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:32,520
released

14124
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:32,640
I've

14125
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:32,910
made

14126
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:33,540
without

14127
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:33,990
the

14128
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,110
an

14129
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:34,830
intranasal

14130
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:35,700
exogenous

14131
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,390
application.

14132
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:37,590
But

14133
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:38,880
what's

14134
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,030
been

14135
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,540
reported

14136
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:39,840
is

14137
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:40,890
increased

14138
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:41,340
positive

14139
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,180
communication

14140
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:42,510
among

14141
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:42,990
couples.

14142
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:43,290
So

14143
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:43,800
people

14144
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:44,160
have

14145
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:44,670
taken

14146
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:45,180
intranasal

14147
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:45,870
oxytocin

14148
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:46,110
in

14149
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:46,530
study.

14150
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:46,860
So

14151
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,040
that

14152
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,340
study

14153
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:47,610
just

14154
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:47,700
if

14155
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:47,910
you,

14156
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:48,360
for

14157
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:48,600
those

14158
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:48,660
of

14159
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:48,720
you

14160
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:48,930
like

14161
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:49,050
was

14162
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:49,320

14163
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:49,380

14166
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:50,670
which

14167
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:50,820
my

14168

told

14171
01:23:52,530 --> 01:23:52,710
me is

14172
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:52,770
a

14173
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:53,070
fine

01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:53,520
journal,

14175
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:54,270
and

14176
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:54,330
the

14177
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:54,720
title

14178
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:54,900
is

14179
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,410
intranasal.

14180
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:56,040
oxytocin

14181
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:56,760
increases

14182
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,180
positive

14183
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:57,840
communication

14184
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:57,990
and

14185
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,650
reduces

14186
01:23:58,650 --> 01:23:58,770
the

14187
01:23:58,770 --> 01:23:59,010
stress

14188
01:23:59,010 --> 01:23:59,310

14189
01:23:59,310 --> 01:23:59,760

14190
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,180

14191
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:00,630
during

14192
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:00,990
couple

14193
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:01,680
conflict.

14194
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,030
They

14195
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:03,180
have

14196
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:03,300
them

14197
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:03,750
fight

14198
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,650
or

14199
01:24:04,650 --> 01:24:04,740
they

14200
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:04,860
have

14201
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:04,980
them

14202
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:05,310
fight

14203
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:05,880
without,

14204
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:06,510
with

14205
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:06,600
and

14206
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,020
without

14207
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:07,830
oxytocin.

14208
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,070
So

14209
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,640
interesting.

14210
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:09,510
I'm

14211
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:09,900
very

14212
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,140

01:24:10,830 --> 01:24:11,220
the

14217
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:11,580
idea

14218
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:11,730
that

14219
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:12,330
oxytocin

14220
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:12,450
is

14221
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:12,660
the

14223
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:13,230
unquote,

14224
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:13,650
trust

14225
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,160
hormone

14226
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,150
that's

14227
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:15,510
in

14228
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,900

that,

14231
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:17,040
that

14232
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:17,190
was a

14233
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:18,030
2009

14234
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:18,480
paper.

14235
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:19,890
There's

14236
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,160
other

14288
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:42,900
I've

14289
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,110
talked

14290
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,290
about

14294
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:44,310
before,

14295
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:44,610
we're

14296
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,660
understanding

14297
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,020
of

14298
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:46,260
what

14299
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:46,770
other

14300
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,180

adults

01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:49,440
are

14305
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,190
experiencing.

14306
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:50,580
So,

14307
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:51,060
you

14308
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:51,180
know,

14309
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:51,840
oxytocin

14310
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,080
does

14311
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:52,290
seem

14312
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:52,410
to

14313
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:52,950
create

14314
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:53,190
these

14315
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:53,700
general

01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:54,240

14317
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,350
and

14318
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,160
how

14319
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,760
nuanced

14320
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:57,000
they

14321
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,240
are

14322
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:57,330
in

14323
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:57,510
one

14324
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:58,050
situation

14325
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:58,500
or

14326
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:58,830
another.

14327
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:58,920
I

14328
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,130
don't

14329
01:24:59,130 --> 01:24:59,460
know.

14330
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:00,270
I I'm

14331
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:00,660
aware

14332
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:00,810
and I

14333
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:01,020
was

14334
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,410
told

14335
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:01,500
and

14336
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:01,620
I'm

14337
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:01,980
definitely

14338
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:02,130
not

14339
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:02,640
recommending

14340
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:02,910
this

14341
01:25:02,910 --> 01:25:03,210
that

14342
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:03,990
there's

14343
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,320
a

14344
01:25:04,530 --> 01:25:05,160

14345
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,030

spray.

14349
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,530
Now,

14350
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:07,740
I

14351
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:07,920
have

14352
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:08,250
no

14353
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:08,850
idea

14354
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:09,150
maybe

14355
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:09,420
someone

14356
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:09,690
can

14357
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,020
put

14358
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:10,110
in

14359
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:10,200
the

14360
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:10,620
comments

14361
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,070
why

14362
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:11,220
you

14363
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:11,310
would

14364
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:11,580
want

14365
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:11,670
to

14366
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:12,240
combine

14367
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:12,990
oxytocin

14368
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:13,140
and

14369
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:13,710
ketamine.

14370
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:14,520
I

14371
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:14,970
can't

14372
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:15,390
imagine

14373
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:15,810
why

14374
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:16,410
ketamine

14375
01:25:16,410 --> 01:25:16,590
is a

14376
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:17,520
dissociative

14377
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:18,240
anesthetic

14378
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:18,420
that's

14379
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:18,630
used

14380
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:18,750
for

14381
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:18,810
the

14382
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:19,140
treatment

14383
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:19,200
of

14384
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,040
PTSD

14385
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:20,820
used

14386
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:21,000
to be

14387
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,210
used

14388
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:21,420
as a

14389
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:22,080
recreational

14390
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,470
drug.

14391
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:23,970
It's

14392
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:24,780
very

14393
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:25,110
similar

14394
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,200
to

14395
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,010
PCP

14396
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,340
seems

14397
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:26,610
quite

14398
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:27,060
dangerous.

14399
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:27,150
In

14400
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:27,600
fact,

14401
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:29,730
I

14402
01:25:29,730 --> 01:25:29,910
don't

14403
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:30,030
know

14404
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:30,390
why

14405
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,690
those

14406
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:30,810
two

14407
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:31,080
things

14408
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:31,320
would

14409
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:31,740
be

14410
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:32,400
combined,

14411
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:33,120
why

14412
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:33,330
one

14413
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:33,510
would

14414
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:33,750
want

14415
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:33,810
to

14416
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:34,200
combine

14417
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:34,440
them.

14418
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:34,920
But

14419
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:35,970
there

14420
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:36,150
are

14421
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:36,630
products

14422
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:36,810
out

14423
01:25:36,810 --> 01:25:36,990
there

14424
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,170
that

14425
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:37,380
seemed

14426
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:37,470
to

14427
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:37,890
combine

14428
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:38,100
those

14429
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,220
two

14430
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:38,580
things.

14431
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:38,880
And

14432
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:39,150
I'm

14433
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:39,540
not

14434
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:39,810
certain

14435
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:40,350
why

14436
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:41,070
one

14437
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:41,220
would

14438
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:41,340
do

14439
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:41,580
that.

14440
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:41,790
But

14441
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:42,210
it's

14442
01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:42,630
interesting

14443
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:42,720
to

14444
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:42,960
note

14445
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:43,320
that

14446
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:43,770
it's

14447
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:44,490
happening.

14448
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:45,270
A

14449
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:45,840
particularly

14450
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,260
interesting

14451
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:46,560
study

14452
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:46,770

oxytocin

14454
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,610

01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:53,430
modulates

14471
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,790
social

14472
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,240
distance

14473
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,750
between

14474
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,260
males

14475
01:25:55,290 --> 01:25:55,470
and

14476
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,190
females.

14477
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:56,610
So

14478
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:56,790
there's

14479
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:57,360
interesting,

14480
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:57,660
what

14481
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:57,750
they

14482
01:25:57,750 --> 01:25:57,930
did

14483
01:25:57,930 --> 01:25:58,080
is

14484
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:58,350
they

14485
01:25:58,470 --> 01:25:58,830
gave

14486
01:25:58,860 --> 01:25:59,790
oxytocin

14487
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:00,630
to

14488
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:01,530
people

14489
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:01,680
that

14490
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:01,860
were

14491
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:02,160
in

14492
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:02,730
monogamous

14493
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,480
relationships,

14494
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:03,630
and

14495
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:03,900
then

14496
01:26:03,930 --> 01:26:04,140
they

14497
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:04,860
evaluated

14498
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:04,950
the

14499
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:05,310
extent

14500
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:05,430
to

14501
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:05,790
which

14502
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:06,420
that

14503
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:06,750
in

14504
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:06,900
this

14505
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:07,110
case,

14506
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:07,200
the

14507
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:07,530
males

14508
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:07,590
in

14509
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,770
those

14510
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:08,430
relationships

14511
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:08,880
would

14512
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:09,300
pay

14513
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:09,780
attention

14514
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,050
to

14515
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:10,410
visual

14516
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:10,830
attention

14517
01:26:10,830 --> 01:26:11,160
to

14518
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:12,120
attractive

14519
01:26:12,150 --> 01:26:12,690
other

14520
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:13,590
potential

14521
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:14,100
partners.

14522
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:14,250
And

14523
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:14,340
it

14524
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:14,790
seemed

14525
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:15,210
like

14526
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,510
that

14527
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:15,600
the

14528
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:15,870
general

14529
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:16,230
takeaway

14530
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:16,410
from

14531
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:16,530
this

14532
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:16,860
study

14533
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:17,010
is

14534
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:17,220
that

14535
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:17,910
oxytocin

14536
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:18,600
administration

14537
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:18,870
seemed

14538
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:18,990
to

14539
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:19,500
promote

14540
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,220
monogamous

14541
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:20,730
behavior.

14542
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,090
So

14543
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:21,450
behavior

14544
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:21,600
that

14545
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:21,720
was

14546
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:21,930
in

14547
01:26:21,930 --> 01:26:22,290
line

14548
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:22,410
with

14549
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:22,920
monogamy

14550
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:23,010
of

14551
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:23,100
the

14552
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:23,730
relationship

14553
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:23,880
that

14554
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:23,970
they

14555
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:24,180
were

14556
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:24,420
in,

14557
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:24,630
as

14558
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:24,960
opposed

14559
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,230
to

14560
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:26,400
foraging

14561
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:26,610
for

14562
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:27,210
potentially

14563
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,480
new

14564
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:27,870
mates.

14565
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:28,170
Now,

14566
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:28,230
of

14567
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:28,590
course,

14568
01:26:28,710 --> 01:26:28,980
these

14569
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:29,040
are

14570
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,340
somewhat

14571
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:29,820
artificial

14572
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,270
experiments

14573
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:30,360
are

14574
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:30,690
very

14575
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:31,140
artificial

14576
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:31,590
experiments,

14577
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:31,980
depending

14578
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,130
on

14579
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:32,280
how

14580
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:32,430
you

14581
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:32,820
interpret

14582
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,090
them.

14583
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:33,720
But

14584
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:34,050
the

14585
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:34,680
general

14586
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:35,160
theme

14587
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:35,400
is

14588
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:35,670
that

14589
01:26:35,730 --> 01:26:36,750
oxytocin

14590
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:37,140
is

14591
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:38,070
promoting

14592
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:39,990
monogamy

14593
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,170
it's

14594
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:40,770
promoting

14595
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:41,040
pair

14596
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:41,490
bonding,

14597
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:41,640
it's

14598
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,240
promoting

14599
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:42,600
a

14600
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:43,980
understanding

14601
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:44,610
of

14602
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:44,850
the

14603
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:45,390
internal

14604
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:45,720
state

14605
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:45,900
of

14606
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,590
others,

14607
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:47,100
which

14608
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:47,670
requires

14609
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:48,240
enhanced

14610
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:48,720
extra

14611
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,290
reception

14612
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:49,680
for

14613
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:49,950
those

14614
01:26:49,950 --> 01:26:50,520
particular

14615
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:50,880
others.

14616
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:50,970
So

14617
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:51,240
not

14618
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:51,480
just

14619
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,290
generally

14620
01:26:52,410 --> 01:26:52,860
having

14621
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:53,100
them

14622
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:53,430
look

14623
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,060
everywhere

14624
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:54,180
and

14625
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:54,300
see

14626
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:54,480
what's

14627
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:54,690
going

14628
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:54,900
on in

14629
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:54,960
the

14630
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:55,230
world,

14631
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:55,470
but

14632
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,250
particularly

14633
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:56,490
paying

14634
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,000
attention

14635
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:57,570
to

14636
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:57,720
the

14637
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,110
emotional

14638
01:26:58,110 --> 01:26:58,500
states

14639
01:26:58,530 --> 01:26:58,680
of

14640
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,130
others.

14641
01:26:59,670 --> 01:26:59,850
I'm

14642
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:00,030
sure

14643
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:00,420
several

14644
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:00,480
of

14645
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:00,630
you

14646
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:00,780
will

14647
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:00,900
be

14648
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:01,230
asking,

14649
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:01,380
Well,

14650
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:01,530
what

14651
01:27:01,530 --> 01:27:01,710
can I

14652
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:01,920
do to

14653
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,280
increase

14654
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,150
oxytocin?

14655
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:03,720
If

14656
01:27:03,720 --> 01:27:03,930
that's

14657
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:04,050
your

14658
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:04,440
goal,

14659
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:04,980
there's

14660
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:05,250
some

14661
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:05,700
evidence

14662
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:05,940
and I

14663
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:06,240
invite

14664
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,360
you

14665
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:06,630
again,

14666
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:07,230
to go

14667
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:07,440
to

14668
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:07,830
examine

14669
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:08,430
calm

14670
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:08,880
or

14671
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:09,690
another

14672
01:27:09,690 --> 01:27:09,900

01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:11,340
that,

14844
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:11,550

14854
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,670
But

14855
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:14,790
it's

14856
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,150
interesting

14857
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:15,240

01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:21,000
are

14877
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:21,210
just

14878
01:28:21,210 --> 01:28:21,570
taking

14879
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:22,320
oxytocin

14880
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:22,890
directly

14881
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:23,070
through

14882
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,220
these

14883
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:23,490
intra

14884
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:23,970
nasal

14885
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:24,720
sprays.

14886
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:24,900
I'm

14887
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:25,200
pretty

14888
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:25,440
sure

14889
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:25,590
it's

14890
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:26,130
prescription

14891
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:26,220
in

14892
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:26,430
most

14893
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:26,880
places,

14894
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,210
but

14895
01:28:27,570 --> 01:28:27,810
but

14896
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:28,230
check

14897
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:28,410
and

14898
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:28,620
again,

14899
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:28,770
I'm

14900
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:28,950
not

14901
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:29,430
recommending

14902
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,790
anybody

14903
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:29,910
do

14904
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:30,240
that.

14905
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:30,570
I've

14906
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:30,780
never

14907
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:31,080
tried

14908
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:31,650
it. I

14909
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:31,800
don't

14910
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:31,890
know

14911
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:32,010
they

14912
01:28:32,010 --> 01:28:32,280
will.

14913
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:32,370
I

14914
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:32,490
think

14915
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:32,550
I'm

14916
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:32,670
going

14917
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:32,730
to

14918
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:32,970
stick

14919
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:33,090
with

14920
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:33,180
the

14921
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:33,900
oxytocin

14922
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:34,140
that

14923
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:34,320
I've

14924
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:34,800
got.

14925
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:35,430
The

14926
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:35,610
other

14927
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:36,120
molecule

14928
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:36,240
that

14929
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:36,390
we

14930
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,720
make

14931
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:36,900
that's

14932
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:37,650
extremely

14933
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:38,190
important

14934
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:38,400
for

14935
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,760
social

14936
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,090
bonds

14937
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:39,180
and

14938
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,050
emotionality

14939
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:40,680
is

14940
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:40,830
one

14941
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:40,920
that

14942
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:41,010
we're

14943
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:41,130
going

14944
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:41,190
to

14945
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:41,400
talk

14946
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:41,580
about

14947
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:41,940
more

14948
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:42,060
in

14949
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:42,120
the

14950
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:42,300
month

14951
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:42,420
on

14952
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:43,110
hormones.

14953
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:43,560
But

14954
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:43,800
that's

14955
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:44,820
vasopressin.

14956
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,530
vasopressin

14957
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:47,850
suppresses

14958
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:48,540
urination.

14959
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:48,660
It

14960
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:48,810
was

14961
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:49,230
actually

14962
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:49,800
developed.

14963
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:50,730
It's

14964
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:50,910
made

14965
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:51,000
by

14966
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:51,120
the

14967
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:51,630
body,

14968
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,290
but

14969
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:52,710
it's

14970
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:52,920
It

14971
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:53,040
was

14972
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:53,430
developed

14973
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:53,610
as a

14974
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:53,970
treatment

14975
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:54,060
for

14976
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:54,300
something

14977
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:54,510
called

14978
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,200
diabetes

14979
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:55,830
insipidus,

14980
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,070
where

14981
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,490
people

14982
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,090
urinate

14983
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:57,810
excessively,

14984
01:28:58,110 --> 01:28:58,410
and

14985
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:58,560
they

14986
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:58,890
actually

14987
01:28:58,890 --> 01:28:59,130
risk

14988
01:28:59,130 --> 01:28:59,850
dehydration

14989
01:28:59,850 --> 01:28:59,970
and

14990
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:00,060
they

14991
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:00,210
can

14992
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:00,420
lose

14993
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:00,630
a lot

14994
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:00,720
of

14995
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,320
electrolytes,

14996
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:01,830
etc.

14997
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,220
So it

14998
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:02,610
causes

14999
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:02,970
water

15000
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,600
retention.

15001
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,500
Alcohol

15002
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,190
consumption,

15003
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,150
inhibits

15004
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,930
vasopressin,

15005
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:07,080
so

15006
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:07,320
large

15007
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:07,620
amounts

15008
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:07,710
of

15009
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,250
alcohol

15010
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:08,580
made

15011
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:08,850
people

15012
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,300
excrete

15013
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:09,570
a lot

15014
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:09,630
of

15015
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,140
fluid,

15016
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,010
and

15017
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:11,160
so

15018
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:11,460
forth.

15019
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:12,150
These

15020
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:12,570
depressant

15021
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:12,840
has

15022
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:13,230
effects

15023
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:13,530
on

15024
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:13,620
the

15025
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,220
brain

15026
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:14,910
directly.

15027
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,480
It

15028
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:15,780
actually

15029
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:16,500
creates

15030
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,220
feelings

15031
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:17,460
of

15032
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:17,910
giddy

15033
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:18,480
love.

15034
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:19,110
It

15035
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,380
also

15036
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,100
increases

15037
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:20,760
memory

15038
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:21,210
with

15039
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:21,510
in

15040
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:21,900
very

15041
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,260
potent

15042
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:22,680
ways.

15043
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:22,980
There's

15044
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:23,010
a

15045
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,280
whole

15046
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:23,970
biohacking

15047
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:24,600
community

15048
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,410
that

15049
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:26,040
has

15050
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:26,280
been

15051
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:26,820
dabbling

15052
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:27,060
with

15053
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,750
vasopressin

15054
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:27,870
for

15055
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:28,110
some

15056
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:28,620
time.

15057
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:29,370
I

15058
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:29,490
have

15059
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:29,700
never

15060
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:29,970
tried

15061
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,150
it, I

15062
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:30,510
certainly

15063
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:30,690
don't

15064
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,050
recommend

15065
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:31,140
it,

15066
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:31,410
it is

15067
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,190
prescription

15068
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:32,910
and

15069
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:33,480
it is

15070
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:33,540
a

15071
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:33,810
pretty

15072
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:34,380
serious

15073
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,070
compound

15074
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:35,820
to

15075
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,300
start,

15076
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:37,380
you

15077
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:37,680
know,

15078
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,280
messing

15079
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:38,610
with

15080
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:39,780
because

15081
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:39,870
it

15082
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,050
has

15083
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,200
so

15084
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:40,410
many

15085
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:40,680
different

15086
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,040
effects

15087
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,130
in

15088
01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:41,190
the

15089
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:41,640
body.

15090
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:42,270
It's

15091
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,480
it's

15092
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:42,930
interesting

15093
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:43,440
because

15094
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,370
it

15095
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:44,850
creates

15096
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:44,940
the

15097
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:45,240
sense

15098
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:45,360
of

15099
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:45,660
giddy

15100
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:45,990
love.

15101
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,230
It's,

15102
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:46,680
it's

15103
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:47,040
also

15104
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:47,490
used

15105
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:48,360
somewhat

15106
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:48,750
as an

15107
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,830
aphrodisiac.

15108
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:50,190
So

15109
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:50,310
it's

15110
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:50,790
similar

15111
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:50,880
to

15112
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,810
oxytocin.

15113
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:52,560
It

15114
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:52,830
also

15115
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:52,950
has

15116
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:53,190
very

15117
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:53,550
interesting

15118
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:53,940
effects

15119
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:54,300
on

15120
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,140
monogamous

15121
01:29:55,170 --> 01:29:55,350
or

15122
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,740
non

15123
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:56,280
monogamous

15124
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:56,880
behavior.

15125
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:57,660
This

15126
01:29:57,690 --> 01:29:58,020
again,

15127
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,200
we

15128
01:29:58,200 --> 01:29:58,350
will

15129
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:58,920
revisit

15130
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,010
in

15131
01:29:59,010 --> 01:29:59,070
the

15132
01:29:59,070 --> 01:29:59,460
future

15133
01:29:59,460 --> 01:29:59,640
but

15134
01:29:59,640 --> 01:29:59,940
there's

15135
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:00,690
A

15136
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:01,350

15140
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:02,460

15141
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:02,550

15142
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,700

15143

15144
01:30:02,970 --> 01:30:03,210

01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:48,420
That's

15281
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:48,690
these

15282
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:49,230
connections

15283
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:49,770
between

15284
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:50,040
the

15285
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:50,580
body

15286
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:51,030
and

15287
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:51,120
the

15288
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,540
viscera,

15289
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:51,930
including

15290
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:51,990
the

15291
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,290
gut,

15292
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:52,380
the

15293
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:52,650
heart,

15294
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:52,740
the

15295
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:53,070
lungs,

15296
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:53,160
and

15297
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:53,220
the

15298
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:53,460
immune

15299
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:53,940
system,

15300
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:54,510
and

15301
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:54,570
the

15302
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:55,020
brain

15303
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:55,170
and

15304
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:55,290
that

15305
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:55,380
the

15306
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:55,650
brain

15307
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:55,770
is

15308
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:56,070
also

15309
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,760
controlling

15310
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:56,970
these

15311
01:30:56,970 --> 01:30:57,450
organs.

15312
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:57,690
So

15313
01:30:57,690 --> 01:30:57,810
it's

15314
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:58,110
a two

15315
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:58,290

15316
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:58,860
street.

15317
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:00,060
There's

15318
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:00,210
this

15319
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:00,420
big

15320
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:00,720

15321
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:00,930

15322
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:01,170
there

15323
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:01,320
that

15324
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:01,350
I

15325
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:01,710
mentioned

15326
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:02,280
before,

15327
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:02,850
that

15328
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:03,810
stimulating

15329
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:03,900
the

15330
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,410

15331
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:04,590

15332
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:04,980

15333
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:05,490

15334
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,180
leads

15335
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:06,390
to

15336
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,020
calmness,

15337
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:07,200
that

15338
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:07,350
it's

15339
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:07,620
always

15340
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:07,770
going

15341
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:07,830

down.

15345
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,360
And

15346
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:09,660
that

15347
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:09,990

15348
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,500

I

15350
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:10,890

this

15446
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:49,440

15562
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:29,280
Now,

01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,140
originally

15567
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:31,620
developed

15568
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:31,890

01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:33,540
it's

15574
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:33,780
now

15575
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:33,990

01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,100

15581
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:36,750

15583
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:37,470
can

15584
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:37,770

15585
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:38,460
increase

15587
01:32:40,110 --> 01:32:40,320
it

15588
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:40,740
seems.

15589
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:41,250
So

15590
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:41,640
again,

15591
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,270
increasing

alertness.

15598
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:45,210
And

15599
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:45,390
it's

15600
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:45,630
just

15601
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:46,470
incredible

15602
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:46,680

01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,040

15605
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:47,430

15611
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:49,500
when

15612
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:49,590
the

15613
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:50,040

15615
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:50,970
stimulated.

15616
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:51,570
Again,

15617
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:51,900
not

15618
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:52,470
calming,

15619
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:52,680
but

15620
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:53,460
activating

15621
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:54,180
alertness.

15622
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:55,110
They're

15623
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,530

15626
01:32:56,490 --> 01:32:56,610
and

15627
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:56,730
they're

and

15630
01:32:57,840 --> 01:32:58,110
he

15631
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:58,590
asks

15632
01:32:58,590 --> 01:32:58,770

doing.

15636
01:32:59,370 --> 01:32:59,490
And

15637
01:32:59,490 --> 01:32:59,820
she,

15638
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:00,060
she

15639
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:00,600
describes

15640
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:00,720
how

15641
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:00,900
she

15645
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:01,920
as

15646
01:33:02,970 --> 01:33:03,750

15652
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:05,790
which

01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:06,030
for

15654
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:06,150
her

15655
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:06,330
just

15656
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:06,540
means

15657
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:06,810
totally

15658
01:33:06,810 --> 01:33:07,020

flat.

15661
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:08,790
Not

15662
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:09,030

15663
01:33:09,030 --> 01:33:09,360
going

15664
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:09,900
on.

15665
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,230
She

15666
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:10,500
talks

15667
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:10,770
about

01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:11,160
how

15669
01:33:11,190 --> 01:33:11,580

15670
01:33:11,610 --> 01:33:11,880
doesn't

15676
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:13,410
She's

15677
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:13,740
really

15678
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:14,520
depressed.

15679
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:15,690
And

15680
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:15,840
he

15681
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,260

01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,280
about.

15697
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,490
That's

15698
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:20,760
actually

15699

And

15702
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:24,510
they

15703
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:24,720
talked

15704
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:24,870

etc.

15709
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:26,310
And

15710
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:26,760
then

15711
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:27,510
she

15712
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:27,870
says,

15713
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,050
you

15714
01:33:28,050 --> 01:33:28,200

been

15717
01:33:28,740 --> 01:33:29,310
down,

15718
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:29,610
just

15719
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:30,150
spiraling

15720
01:33:30,150 --> 01:33:30,720
down

15721
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:30,990
talks

15722
01:33:30,990 --> 01:33:31,170

15728
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:34,530
So

15729
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:34,830
this

15730
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:34,950

And

15741
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:38,400
then

15742
01:33:38,430 --> 01:33:38,730
she

15743
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,210

she

15754
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:43,290
had

15755
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:43,440

01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:47,790
to 30

15765
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,360
seconds,

15766
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:48,870
but

15767
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:49,050

15775
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:51,360
So he

15776
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:51,600
says,

15777
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:51,930
Okay,

I

15779
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:52,200

01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:52,290
we

15781
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:52,440

01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:53,160
you're

15786
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:53,670
tolerating

15787
01:33:53,670 --> 01:33:53,970
things

15788
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:54,330
well,

15789
01:33:55,710 --> 01:33:55,890
they

15790
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:56,490
start,

15791
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:57,900
skip

15792
01:33:57,900 --> 01:33:58,020
the

01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:02,250
minutes,

15804
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:02,820

she

15816
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:06,570
became

she'd

15831
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:10,980
recently

15832
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:11,220

15839
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,200
hot.

15840
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,000
She

15841
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:15,120
was

15842
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:15,330
still

15843
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:15,780
smiling

15844
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:15,870
and

15845
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:16,200
talking

15846
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:16,290
when

15847
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:16,350
the

15848
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:16,740

15849
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:17,310
ended,

15850
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:17,850
and

15851
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:17,940
they

15852
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:18,180
walked

15853
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:18,300

15858
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,530
So

15859
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:19,680
this

15860
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:19,830
is

15861
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:20,100

Well,

15883
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:27,660
fascinating

15884
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:27,810
in

15885
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,020

01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:28,170
the

15888
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:28,350
brain

15889
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:28,590
body

15890
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,100
connection

15891
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:29,640
to

15892
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:30,270
I'd

15893
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:30,450
like

15894
01:34:30,450 --> 01:34:30,660
to

15895
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:31,830
keep

15896
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:32,220
trying

15897
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:32,310
to

15898
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,850
dispel

15899
01:34:32,850 --> 01:34:32,970
the

15900
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:33,390
myth

15901
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:33,900
that

15902
01:34:33,930 --> 01:34:34,320
Vegas

15903
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:34,920
stimulation

15904
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:35,010
is

15905
01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:35,160
all

15906
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:35,400
about

15907
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:35,550
being

15908
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:35,940
calm.

15909
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:36,060
It's

15910
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:36,240
really

15911
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:36,420
about

15912
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:36,570
being

15913
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:37,110
alert.

15914
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:37,740
I

15915
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:37,830
don't

15916
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:37,920
know

15917
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:38,220
how

15918
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:38,400
that

15919
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:38,820
originally

15920
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:39,030
got

15921
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:39,240
going

15922
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:39,810
backwards,

15923
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,110
but

15924
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,130
it's

15925
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:41,310
about

15926
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:41,490
being

15927
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:41,880
alert.

15928
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,720
And

15929
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,080
once

15930
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:43,680
again,

15931
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:44,250
level

15932
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:44,400
of

15933
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,000
alertness

15934
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,150
or

15935
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:45,450
level

15936
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:45,540
of

15937
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:46,140
calmness

15938
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:46,320
is

15939
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,010
impacting

15940
01:34:47,010 --> 01:34:47,610
emotion,

15941
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:47,970
that

15942
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:48,180
this

15943
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:48,750
access

15944
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:48,900
of

15945
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,320
alertness

15946
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:49,440
and

15947
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:50,130
calmness

15948
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:50,820
is

15949
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:51,420
one

15950
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:52,170
primary

15951
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:52,920
axis

15952
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:53,490
in

15953
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,180
emotion.

15954
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,600
It's

15955
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:54,780
not

15956
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:54,930
the

15957
01:34:54,930 --> 01:34:55,260
only

15958
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:55,530
one

15959
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:55,800
because

15960
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:55,980
there's

15961
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:56,220
also

15962
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:56,400
this

15963
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:56,820
valence

15964
01:34:56,820 --> 01:34:57,300
component

15965
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:57,450
of

15966
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:57,660
good

15967
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:57,780
or

15968
01:34:57,780 --> 01:34:58,260
bad

15969
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:58,770
and

15970
01:34:58,770 --> 01:34:58,980
it's

15971
01:34:59,070 --> 01:34:59,370
those

15972
01:34:59,370 --> 01:34:59,520
two

15973
01:34:59,520 --> 01:34:59,820
aren't

15974
01:34:59,820 --> 01:34:59,970
the

15975
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:00,150
Only

15976
01:35:00,150 --> 01:35:00,420
once

15977
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:00,630
because

15978
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:00,780
there's

15979
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:01,050
also

15980
01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:01,200
this

15981
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:01,620
component

15982
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:01,740
of

15983
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,550
interoceptive

15984
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:03,330
exteroceptive,

15985
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:03,420
that

15986
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:03,510
we

15987
01:35:03,510 --> 01:35:03,720
talked

15988
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:03,870
about

15989
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:04,170
earlier.

15990
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:04,350
And

15991
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:04,470
there

15992
01:35:04,470 --> 01:35:04,620
will

15993
01:35:04,620 --> 01:35:04,770
be

15994
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:05,190
others

15995
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:05,610
too.

15996
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,000
Again,

15997
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:06,120
it's

15998
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,360
not

15999
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:06,990
exhaustive.

16000
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:07,410
But I

16001
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:07,650
find

16002
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:07,740
it

16003
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:08,460
fascinating.

16004
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:08,550
And

16005
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:08,640
it

16006
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:08,880
really

16007
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,210
brings

16008
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:09,390
us

16009
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:09,840
back

16010
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:10,050
to

16011
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:10,440
where

16012
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:10,740
we

16013
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:11,160
started,

16014
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:11,370
which

16015
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:11,550
is,

16016
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:11,940
what

16017
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:12,000
are

16018
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:12,090
the

16019
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:12,330
core

16020
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:12,750
elements

16021
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:12,840
of

16022
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,380
emotion?

16023
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:13,680
And

16024
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:13,800
what

16025
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:13,920
can

16026
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,040
you

16027
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,250
do

16028
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:14,550
about

16029
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:14,790
them.

16030
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:15,570
And

16031
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,230
before

16032
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:16,380
we

16033
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:16,710
close

16034
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:16,950
up

16035
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,340
today,

16036
01:35:17,370 --> 01:35:17,490

16037

01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:17,940
want

16039

make

16041
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:18,510
sure

16042
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:18,810
that

16043
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:19,170
even

16044
01:35:19,170 --> 01:35:19,290
though

16045
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:19,440
I've

16046
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:19,830

things

16066
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:26,130
that

01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:26,550

16068
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:27,390

16070
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:28,410

01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:30,000

16078
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:30,180
can

16079
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:31,170
conceptualize

01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:31,740
emotions.

16081
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:32,490
This

most

16092
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:35,910
powerful

16093
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:36,480
tool

16094
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:36,870
you

16095
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:37,110
can

16096
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:37,500
ever

16097
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,040
have,

16098
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:38,820
in

16099
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,060
terms

16100
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:39,180
of

16101
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:39,810
understanding

16102
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:39,900
and

16103
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:40,410
regulating

16104
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:40,530
your

16105
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:40,980
emotional

16106
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,400
state,

16107
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:41,730
if

16108
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:41,880
you're

16109
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:42,180
willing

16110
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:42,510
to

16111
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,410
try

16112
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:43,500
and

16113
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:43,770
wrap

16114
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:43,890
your

16115
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:44,070
head

16116
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,310
around

16117
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:44,490
it, I

16118
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:44,850
realize

16119
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:44,970
it's

16120
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,180
not

16121
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:45,270
the

16122
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,750
simplest

16123
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:45,930
thing

16124
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:46,050
to

16125
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:46,410
do.

16126
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:47,070
But

16127
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:47,670
rather

16128
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:47,760
than

16129
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:47,940
think

16130
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:48,060
of

16131
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:48,630
emotions,

16132
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:48,780
as

16133
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:49,020
just

16134
01:35:49,020 --> 01:35:49,200
these

16135
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:49,620
labels,

16136
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,100
happy,

16137
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:50,730
sad

16138
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,330
or

16139
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,200
depressed,

16140
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:52,980
thinking

16141
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:53,370
them

16142
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,910
thinking

16143
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:54,180
about

16144
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:54,930
emotions,

16145
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:55,470
excuse

16146
01:35:55,470 --> 01:35:55,710
me,

16147
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:56,580
as

16148
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,310
elements

16149
01:35:59,310 --> 01:35:59,430
of

16150
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,520
the

01:35:59,520 --> 01:35:59,790
brain

16152
01:35:59,790 --> 01:35:59,910
and

16153
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:00,420
body,

16154
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:01,170
that

16155
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:01,890
encompass

16156
01:36:01,890 --> 01:36:02,220
levels

16157
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:02,310
of

16158
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:02,910
alertness

16159
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:03,210
that

16160
01:36:03,210 --> 01:36:03,870
include

16161
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:03,930
a

16162
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:04,440
dynamic

16163
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:04,590
with

16164
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:04,710
the

16165
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:05,160
outside

16166
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:05,550
world,

16167
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:05,730
and

16168
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:05,880
your

16169
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:06,360
perception

16170
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:06,450
of

16171
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:06,600
your

16172
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,020
internal

16173
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:07,410
state.

16174
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:08,100
And

16175
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:08,490
starting

16176
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:08,850
to

16177
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:09,330
really

16178
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:09,540
think

16179
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:09,750
about

16180
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:10,290
emotions

16181
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:10,470
in a

01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:11,130
structured

16183
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:11,520
way,

16184
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,120
can

16185
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:12,420
not

16186
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:12,960
only

16187
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:13,440
allow

16188
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:13,560
you

16189
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:13,680
to

16190
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:14,370
understand

16191
01:36:14,370 --> 01:36:14,550
some

16192
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,610
of

16193
01:36:14,610 --> 01:36:14,700
the

16194
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,450
pathology

16195
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:15,540
of

16196
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:15,900
when

16197
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,080
you

16198
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:16,350
know,

16199
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:16,620
you

16200
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:16,800
might

16201
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,010
feel

16202
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:17,550
depressed

16203
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:17,700
or

16204
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:18,150
anxious

16205
01:36:18,150 --> 01:36:18,270
or

16206
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:18,540
others

16207
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:18,630
are

16208
01:36:18,630 --> 01:36:19,020
depressed

16209
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:19,110
and

16210
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:19,500
anxious,

16211
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:19,890
but

16212
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:20,310
also

16213
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:20,460
to

16214
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:20,910
develop

16215
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:21,090
a

16216
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:21,750
richer,

16217
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:22,320
emotional

16218
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:22,890
experience

16219
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:22,980
to

16220
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:23,580
anything.

16221
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:23,970
Now,

16222
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:24,090
of

16223
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:24,330
course,

16224
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:24,420
I

16225
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:24,660
don't

16226
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:25,020
expect

16227
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:25,170
that

16228
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:25,380
as

16229
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:25,530
you're

16230
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:25,800
out

16231
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,190
there,

16232
01:36:26,370 --> 01:36:27,030
interacting

16233
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:27,180
with

16234
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:27,600
friends,

16235
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:27,720
and

16236
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:27,840
you're

16237
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:28,170
watching

16238
01:36:28,170 --> 01:36:28,590
TV

16239
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:28,710
and

16240
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:29,250
experiencing

16241
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:29,490
life

16242
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:29,610
that

16243
01:36:29,610 --> 01:36:29,700
you

16244
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:29,880
should

16245
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:29,970
be

16246
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:30,450
parsing

16247
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:30,690
every

16248
01:36:30,690 --> 01:36:31,020
bit

16249
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:31,770
of

16250
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:31,950
your

16251
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:32,550
experience

16252
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,820
in

16253
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:33,000
some

16254
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,180
sort

16255
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:33,240
of

16256
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:33,960
reductionist

16257
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:34,050
and

16258
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:34,620
mechanistic

16259
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:34,830
way,

16260
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:35,130
that's

16261
01:36:35,130 --> 01:36:35,400
not

16262
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:35,490
the

16263
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:35,700
goal

16264
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:36,030
here.

16265
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:36,450
But

16266
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:36,540
for

16267
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:36,720
those

01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:41,070
for

16300
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:46,380
there,

16301
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:46,650
I say

16302
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:46,740
the

16303
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:47,130

01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:49,740
believe

16309
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:49,890
that

16310
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:50,190
these

16311
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:50,550
are

16312
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,420
fundamental

16313
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:52,110
elements

16314
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:52,560
that

16315
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:52,680
are

16316
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:53,070
well

16317
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:53,670
supported

16318
01:36:53,670 --> 01:36:53,820
by

16319
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:53,940

16324
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:55,440

16325
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,280

16326
01:36:56,370 --> 01:36:56,850
doing

16327
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:57,660

16335
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:00,150
and

16336
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:00,450
some

16337
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:00,510
of

16338
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:00,660
whom

16339
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:00,870
agree

16340
01:37:00,870 --> 01:37:00,990
with

16341
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:01,200
one

16347
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:02,580
don't.

16348
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:04,200
So I

16349
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:04,560
offer

16350
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:04,800

which

16358
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:07,470
you

16359
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:07,710
can

16360
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:08,190
start

16361
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:08,310
to

16362
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:08,700
think

16363
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:09,150
about

16364
01:37:09,180 --> 01:37:09,720

16367
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:11,520
differently,

16368
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:11,670
I

16369
01:37:11,670 --> 01:37:12,090
hope,

16370
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:12,600
as

16371
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:12,870
well

16372
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:13,020
as

16373
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:13,530
others

16374
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:13,860
in a

16375
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:14,040
way

16376
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:14,190
that

16377
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:14,460
builds

16378
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:14,670
more

16380
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:15,420
into

16381
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:15,630
that

16382
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,260
experience.

16383
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:16,740
Not

16384
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:16,890
that

16385
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:17,370
detracts

16386
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:17,580
from

16387
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:17,820
it.

16388
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:18,750
One

16392
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:20,100
relates

16393
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:20,250
to

16394
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:20,670
that

16395
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:21,600

16396
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:21,720

16398
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:21,990
have

16399
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:22,410
asked

16400
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:22,650
me

16401
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,220

emerging

16408
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:25,950
things

16409
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:26,160
like

16410
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:26,760
silicides,

16411
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:27,030
and

16412
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:27,780
MDMA.

16413
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:28,890
We

16414
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:29,280
are,

16415
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:29,400

16423
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,280
deeply.

16424
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:32,460
We

16425
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:32,640
have

16426
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:32,730
an

expert

16428
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:33,480

01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:34,380
on to

16432
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:34,890
that

16433
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:35,400
topic.

16434
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:36,420
Those

16435
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,110
compounds

16436
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:37,740
clearly

16437
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:38,370
affect

16438
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,360
the

16439
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:40,830
aspects

16440
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:40,920
of

01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:41,610
emotionality

16442
01:37:41,610 --> 01:37:41,760
that

16443
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:41,880
we

16444
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:41,970
were

16445
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:42,300
talking

16446
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:42,540
about

16447
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:43,020
today.

16448
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,280
calmness,

16449
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:45,300
alertness,

16450
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:46,500
valence,

16451
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:46,830
good

16452
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:46,920
or

16453
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:47,310
bad

16454
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,540
interoceptive

16455
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:48,990
extra

positioning.

16458
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:51,060
And

16459
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:51,480
so

16460
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:52,260
rather

16461
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:52,620
than

16462
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:53,310
just

16463
01:37:53,310 --> 01:37:53,550
do a

16471
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,400
and

16472
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:56,640
what

16473
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:56,730
the

16475
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:57,480

16476
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:57,930

16478
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:58,470
is

01:37:59,040 --> 01:37:59,310
them,

16482
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:00,090
and

16483
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:00,210
how

16484
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:00,330
they

16485
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:00,930
function,

16486
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:01,830
I

16487
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:01,950
think

16488
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:02,070
it's

16489
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,280
more

01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:03,450
embed

16493
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:03,840
that

16498
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:05,550
so

16499
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:05,700
that

16500
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:05,880
when

16501
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,240
we

01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:07,650
we

different

emotive

16518
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:12,810

16519
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:13,110
that

01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:13,500
relate

16521
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:13,650

individuals

16523
01:38:14,370 --> 01:38:14,640

couples,

16525
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:15,810
etc,

16526
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:16,800
that

16527
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:16,980
we

16528
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:17,070
are

16529
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:17,340
able

16530
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:17,700
to

16531
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:18,120
think

16532
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:18,420
about

16533
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:18,690
them

16534
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:19,230
with

16535
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:19,530
some

16536
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:19,740
sort

16537
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:19,800

16539
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:20,400
and

16540
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:20,880
rigor,

16541
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,390
rather

16542
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:21,540
than

16543
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:21,780
just

16544
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:22,020
talk

16545
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:22,290
about

16546
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:22,470
them

16547
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,040
as a

16548
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:23,310
bunch

16549
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:23,370
of

16550
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:24,030
chemicals

16551
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,270
that

16552
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:24,660
produce

16553
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:24,870
these

16554
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,290
amazing

16555
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:26,130
experiences

16556
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:26,940
that

16557
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:27,180
people

16558
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:27,360
need

16559
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:27,480
to

16560
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:27,660
tell

16561
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:27,780
you

16562
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:28,110
about.

16563
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:28,350
Because

16564
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:28,440
if

16565
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:28,770
there's

16566
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,190
one

16567
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:29,610
truth,

16568
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:29,970
it

16569
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:30,270
seems

16570
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:30,480
that

16571
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,020
psychedelics

16572
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,230
seem

16573
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:31,500
to

16574
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:32,040
promote

16575
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:32,820
activity

16576
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:33,120
of

16577
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:33,810
storytelling

16578
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:34,050
about

16579
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:34,590
psychedelic

16580
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:35,220
experience,

16581
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:35,430
but

16582
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:35,670
that

16583
01:38:35,670 --> 01:38:36,330
itself

16584
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:36,660
is

16585
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:36,930
not

16586
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:37,380
really

16587
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:37,560
what

16588
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:37,650
the

16589
01:38:37,650 --> 01:38:38,160
therapeutic

16590
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:38,730
community

16591
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:38,880
and

16592
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:39,090
the

16593
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:39,930
academic

16594
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:40,170
and

16595
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:40,800
communities

16596
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:40,950
are

16597
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:41,370
interested

16598
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:41,580
in.

16599
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:41,970
They're

16600
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:42,420
interested

16601
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:42,660
in

16602
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:42,990
trying

16603
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:43,050
to

16604
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:43,770
understand

16605
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:44,040
the

16606
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:44,760
universal

16607
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:45,480
truths,

16608
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:45,900
the

16609
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:46,620
universal

16610
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,310
biological

16611
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:47,670
shifts

16612
01:38:47,670 --> 01:38:47,790
and

16613
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:48,390
psychological

16614
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,780
shifts

16615
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:49,110
that

16616
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:49,590
occur

16617
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:50,250
in

16618
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,340
the

16619
01:38:50,340 --> 01:38:50,700
clinical

16620
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:50,910
use

16621
01:38:50,910 --> 01:38:51,030
of

16622
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,240
those

16623
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:51,810
compounds.

16624
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:51,960
And

16625
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,290
so

16626
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:52,560
we're

16627
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:52,680
going

16628
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:52,740
to

16629
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:52,920
hold

16630
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:53,070
off

16631
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:53,190
for

16632
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:53,550
now,

16633
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:53,700
but

16634
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:53,850
we

16635
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:54,000
will

16636
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,240
get

16637
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:54,330
to

16638
01:38:54,330 --> 01:38:54,570
them.

16639
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:55,230
Once

16640
01:38:55,230 --> 01:38:55,500
again,

16641
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:55,650
we've

16642
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,010
covered

16643
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:56,160
an

16644
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:56,580

16648
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:57,750
today,

16649
01:38:57,780 --> 01:38:57,930
it's

16650
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,140
really

16651
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:58,260
the

16652
01:38:58,260 --> 01:38:58,740
