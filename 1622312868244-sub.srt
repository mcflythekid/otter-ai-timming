1
00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:12,870
You got to be prepared. And you got to recognize too, that it's not personal. She's not trying to shit on you. She's not trying to be nasty to you.

2
00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:20,160
On the contrary, a girl will only give a shit test to a guy that she is seriously considering.

3
00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:29,640
She won't waste her time with a guy that she does not take seriously. Yeah, I should test when you start getting shit tests from the girl,

4
00:00:29,820  -->  00:00:35,160
it means that you're on track with the girl, okay? And that's why you have to prepare this shit.

5
00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:44,220
Don't think that you can just laugh it off some shit tests these shit tests, they're very, very serious. Because see,

6
00:00:44,250  -->  00:00:53,040
a girl will never really want you until you have passed the shit tests that she puts on you. Okay, so understand how crucial they are.

7
00:00:53,370  -->  00:01:12,270
But don't freak out about it. The way you have to handle them is with humor. What are shit tests? I mean, this is a reasonable question.

8
00:01:12,270  -->  00:01:23,790
And men get hit by shit tests from women all the time. So the question what are shit tests is simply put, they are compliance tests,

9
00:01:23,970  -->  00:01:34,440
they are tests to make sure that the item in question is up to spec. Let me explain z A lot of times a woman will shit test a guy.

10
00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:37,980
Now what does that mean? That's a colloquialism from game shit test, right.

11
00:01:38,310  -->  00:01:47,940
And what it means is that basically a woman will say something to a guy who that will put him like off balance,

12
00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:59,790
she will poke at him to see if he is as manly and assured and confident as he is projecting himself to be. You say, I mean, like, for instance,

13
00:01:59,790  -->  00:02:07,500
with a product testing a compliance test of a product, you you take some products, I don't know your man manufacturing some widget, right?

14
00:02:07,800  -->  00:02:16,680
And you take that product and you you start taking it apart and trying to break it to see if it is up to standard, you know, if it breaks very easily,

15
00:02:16,680  -->  00:02:22,770
then clearly it fails the compliance test and the product is no good. But if it breaks, but it's actually very hard to break it,

16
00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:29,370
it requires X amount of force, I mean, who knows a ton of force or whatever, for the widget to break, then you say, Oh, it's in compliance,

17
00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:30,870
it's within the parameters, right?

18
00:02:31,710  -->  00:02:41,040
That's what a woman is doing with a guy when she should test she is trying to ensure that the confidence that he is projecting is actual and not a lie.

19
00:02:41,100  -->  00:02:48,570
Because you see, it's very easy for a guy to pretend to be something that he isn't, okay. You see a guy like at, you know,

20
00:02:48,570  -->  00:02:54,570
some club and he's dressed really nicely, right? And he's like, very well groomed and maybe has like, I don't know,

21
00:02:54,570  -->  00:03:00,390
like a gold chain or some shit like that. Right? And so what is he projecting he is projecting out in the world out into the world,

22
00:03:00,810  -->  00:03:12,630
projecting to women that he has a good income that he you know, has resources. And you know, the the gold chain and the nice expensive flashy clothes.

23
00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:21,570
They're all to make sure that people know that he has resources right there a signal, okay? He's not flashing around like a wad of bills,

24
00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:31,620
but the clothes are basically acting the same way. Right? And so what will a girl do to to see if he's for real? She'll shit test him. And she'll say,

25
00:03:31,620  -->  00:03:38,160
Oh, well, what are you driving? And if the guy sort of like Wilson says, you know, something like, Oh, well, I came on the bus.

26
00:03:38,790  -->  00:03:46,260
Then she realizes that the facade you know, the expensive clothes, the potential jewelry, which I find just absurd, but whatever.

27
00:03:46,920  -->  00:03:54,150
Or whatever the fuck, that is all a facade. That's what you'll realize. If you came on a bus, it means that you didn't have a pot to piss in, right?

28
00:03:54,510  -->  00:04:01,290
If he came in a limo with his own driver, you know, and his actual driver, not like a hired limo, but like, you know,

29
00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:10,560
a limo driver that works for him. 24 seven, then she'll be like, Oh, you know, he's the real deal. But you see the problem that girl has seen.

30
00:04:10,830  -->  00:04:18,840
She wants to make sure that the guy she meets who is projecting a certain image is actually that thing you see,

31
00:04:18,840  -->  00:04:26,730
because a guy what's the guy looking for in a woman? A hot woman? That's all he cares about. Right? She could be dumb as a brick, right?

32
00:04:26,760  -->  00:04:34,620
And totally poor. I mean, popper poor, right? It does not matter because what does a guy want in a woman? She wants her to be hot.

33
00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:44,100
If she's sexually attractive, she could be an idiot and poor and he won't mind. Yeah, I mean, come on. Yeah, really, you know, now of course,

34
00:04:44,100  -->  00:04:52,050
because because from an evolutionary perspective, we are pushed towards selecting mates who are attractive, who are physically attractive,

35
00:04:52,410  -->  00:05:00,540
because that will mean that if she is physically attractive, and she has long hair and other certain signs of long term health You know,

36
00:05:00,540  -->  00:05:08,670
it will ensure to us that if we have children with her, these children will be healthy. They might be stupid, but they'll be healthy,

37
00:05:08,670  -->  00:05:18,120
at least you see, I'm saying, right. And so that's why we care about how good looking girl is. We care about, you know, skin without blemishes,

38
00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:24,240
you know, because if she has, like Bella wishes, it's probably because she's six, somehow, we care about her having long, long hair,

39
00:05:24,240  -->  00:05:30,330
because if she has long hair, well, it takes at least a couple of years to grow out hair. That's like shoulder length. Right?

40
00:05:30,720  -->  00:05:39,720
And that means that she has had long term health because, again, you know, certain many illnesses, right? damage a woman's hair, and it falls out.

41
00:05:39,750  -->  00:05:45,960
Okay? This is in the past no longer the case today, but you see what's going on? Just by looking at her,

42
00:05:46,710  -->  00:05:51,510
we can tell if she's sexually attractive or not. But that's not the case for women now,

43
00:05:51,510  -->  00:05:58,710
because what women are looking for in a man is social position, social dominance. That's what they're looking for. Okay?

44
00:05:59,010  -->  00:06:07,500
They are not looking for money. That's what stupid men think. And they are not looking for the guy who's the most attractive again,

45
00:06:07,500  -->  00:06:14,940
that's what stupid guys think. No, no, what they want is social position, a man with a high status,

46
00:06:15,120  -->  00:06:23,730
because a man with a high status means that any child she has with him will be protected. That's what she wants. That's what she wants,

47
00:06:23,730  -->  00:06:32,040
because it's been selected by evolution. Okay, this isn't going to change anytime soon, it will never change insofar as human beings are concerned,

48
00:06:32,370  -->  00:06:40,620
women will always be attracted to a man who has high social position. Okay. And so because of that they have to check.

49
00:06:41,370  -->  00:06:47,430
And that's why they should test. Because if that social position is not obvious to everybody,

50
00:06:47,730  -->  00:06:54,540
she will have to make sure that it's true that she will have to make sure that what the guy is projecting to her is real and not bullshit.

51
00:06:54,690  -->  00:07:02,010
Let me give you a simple example. Leonardo DiCaprio is a famous actor. He's won an Oscar. He's been in a bunch of very successful pictures, right?

52
00:07:02,310  -->  00:07:08,910
Okay, so you see him walking down the street, and there's wearing a baseball cap and a ratty old t shirt, right? Any girl who sees him? Right?

53
00:07:08,910  -->  00:07:15,840
What you're going to think is you're going to think that, oh, that guy is dressed really badly. No, she's gonna say, holy shit. That's the DiCaprio.

54
00:07:16,110  -->  00:07:23,940
He doesn't have to prove his social worth. Because he's the DiCaprio. Everybody knows who he is. He's a famous actor. He can go anywhere, you know,

55
00:07:23,940  -->  00:07:29,400
in private jets. And he's got a boatload of money because of his career, right? He doesn't have to prove anything.

56
00:07:29,550  -->  00:07:36,180
He doesn't have to project anything. He doesn't have to show off how rich he is. He doesn't have to wave around his Oscar.

57
00:07:36,330  -->  00:07:47,310
He doesn't have to do anything because everybody knows. Okay. His social position is the fact that he's at the very tippy top of the social hierarchy.

58
00:07:47,670  -->  00:07:52,290
Because he's Leo DiCaprio, because everybody knows who he is, right? So he doesn't have to do shit,

59
00:07:52,680  -->  00:08:01,950
insofar as proving to some girl is worth his social worth. Because he's Leo DiCaprio. And that's why, you know, he can go to you know,

60
00:08:01,950  -->  00:08:14,880
just a black tie event full of supermodels dressed in a ratty t shirt and shorts and flip flops and old baseball cap without having shaved for three days where everybody else is dressed to the nines.

61
00:08:14,880  -->  00:08:20,940
He just shows up, you know, Crick's a finger at the hottest thing there and that hottest thing there,

62
00:08:20,970  -->  00:08:29,580
she'll leave with him on the spot and go fuck his brains out the capital Ville or wherever the fuck instantly because he's the DiCaprio,

63
00:08:29,580  -->  00:08:36,510
he doesn't have to prove anything. But you do instead Why? Okay, most guys, the vast majority of guys, right?

64
00:08:36,780  -->  00:08:47,910
Because we live in the modernist society that we do we because we live in a society where who we are is not obvious because there is no social history among us.

65
00:08:48,060  -->  00:08:55,650
Because we're all floating independently, we are these floating atoms who collide against one another, right? And so a girl comes across you,

66
00:08:55,740  -->  00:09:03,150
she has no idea how successful you are. She has no idea of your position in your business or career. She has no idea.

67
00:09:03,150  -->  00:09:09,780
So she has to test you to make sure that you are who you claim to be, ergo shit tests.

68
00:09:09,810  -->  00:09:16,440
Now the funny thing is that a lot of guys were very successful with a lot of guys who've got a lot going for them, they fail miserably. Okay.

69
00:09:16,920  -->  00:09:26,760
Because you see in the past in the pre modern era, in a society in a mill you right, first of all, it was relatively small, you know,

70
00:09:27,090  -->  00:09:33,150
it would be between maybe 100 people and maybe 500 people and everybody sort of like knew everybody else,

71
00:09:33,330  -->  00:09:42,330
and everybody had connections to one another. So everybody had a fairly decent idea of who was who, right. That was in the past. I'm talking you know,

72
00:09:42,540  -->  00:09:50,580
at least 100 years ago or if not earlier, but all throughout history before that, okay. But now today in our current value,

73
00:09:50,610  -->  00:09:55,920
where we're all floating independent of one another, since there is no social track record,

74
00:09:55,950  -->  00:10:03,900
since a girl who meets you will have no idea who your parents are. Or who your clan is or who your tribe is or in shit like that.

75
00:10:04,200  -->  00:10:08,970
She will have no idea who you are. So she will have to figure out who you are.

76
00:10:09,450  -->  00:10:18,600
And as she figures out who you are by doing these shit tests to see if you are a confident individual to see if you are a man with actual resources,

77
00:10:18,600  -->  00:10:31,110
or you're just bullshitting to see if you are the man, she thinks you are. She's going to inflict shit tests on you. And it's not personal. Okay?

78
00:10:31,650  -->  00:10:43,830
It's not personal. But it has a very clear purpose. And the tragedy is that a lot of guys who've got a lot going for them fail these shit tests.

79
00:10:44,160  -->  00:10:51,780
They don't know how to handle them. Not only have I seen this in other guys, it's sometimes it's happened to me. Oh, yeah. I mean, more than once,

80
00:10:51,780  -->  00:10:58,470
you know, some girl would shit test me and I didn't know how to handle it. Sometimes I was caught off guard sometimes because the girl was very,

81
00:10:58,470  -->  00:11:05,790
very attractive. I was intimidated. I couldn't think of something on spot. Okay. Because I mean, like anybody any guy will tell you of course,

82
00:11:06,030  -->  00:11:15,390
is a lot of times you know, a very attractive girl will, her mere presence will rob you of like, the 15 to 25 IQ points for crying out loud.

83
00:11:15,390  -->  00:11:17,880
It's it's kind of pathetic, but it's the truth. You know?

84
00:11:18,450  -->  00:11:27,120
You come across some girl that's very attractive or whom you consider very attractive a lot of times you get all insecure nervous and you Bumble around like a fucking retard.

85
00:11:27,120  -->  00:11:32,610
But Wow, that's life. That's one of the problems but anyway, it's happened to me. It's happened to every guy.

86
00:11:33,840  -->  00:11:51,570
A girl will give you some shit test and you will fail it you will fail it even though you would have complied even though she was shit testing you to see if you were confident she was shit testing you to see if you were successful shit testing you for whatever fucking reason,

87
00:11:51,930  -->  00:12:03,990
you would have passed the shit test. But you got nervous. Yeah, it happens to every guy. no exception. And so don't worry about it. Yeah,

88
00:12:03,990  -->  00:12:10,740
don't worry about it. But by the same token, you know, don't learn to live with it. Okay. You know, I'm saying I mean, what I'm saying is basically,

89
00:12:11,100  -->  00:12:18,420
you got to learn to deal with shit tests. You got to learn how to handle a woman when she throws a shit test your way.

90
00:12:18,930  -->  00:12:28,500
And how do you learn to do it by fucking practice? Yeah, going out there. Yeah, the more times you are hit with a shit test,

91
00:12:28,830  -->  00:12:40,200
the better you will be at responding to it. Especially the more you understand what is going on, the better you will do with shit tests.

92
00:12:40,260  -->  00:12:48,810
The first step is to classify What the shit test is about a girl will shit test you to see if you have confidence as opposed to Ursa. It's confidence.

93
00:12:49,140  -->  00:12:56,550
She's going to shit test you to see if you have resources, she's going to shit test you to see if you have social connections and more importantly,

94
00:12:56,730  -->  00:13:08,220
if you're socially adroit if you're socially on the ball, okay, and she will shit test you to see if this is the trickiest one of them all. You see,

95
00:13:08,640  -->  00:13:19,440
she will shit test you to see if she is the best thing you've ever been with. Or if you've been with better. Yeah,

96
00:13:20,100  -->  00:13:27,360
let me start with this one guys compete for women. But of course, women compete for guys. Oh, yeah, they compete ruthlessly with one another, okay.

97
00:13:27,720  -->  00:13:38,730
And a woman is always looking for a guy who can attract a girl who is better than her. Okay. This happened to me a bunch of times over the years,

98
00:13:38,730  -->  00:13:44,730
you know, like, I wanted to date girl a. And she was like, say like an eight, right?

99
00:13:45,180  -->  00:13:51,960
And she didn't really want to date me or she wasn't really that interested. But then she spotted me dating a girl who was a nine or a 10.

100
00:13:51,960  -->  00:14:03,420
And automatically. I was fascinating to her. Yeah, yeah, girls always want to be dating a guy who can get the girl who's hotter than her. Okay.

101
00:14:03,930  -->  00:14:06,540
I mean, in the case of guys, because I know this, you know,

102
00:14:06,540  -->  00:14:14,700
a lot of times a guy will be relatively insecure about trying to date a girl who's dated a guy that they believe is a better than they are.

103
00:14:15,540  -->  00:14:20,610
He's going to feel insecure. And you know, it's not going to be an easy thing for the guy, right?

104
00:14:20,730  -->  00:14:28,980
But girls are they get off on trying to land the guy who has been with better women than them hotter women than them.

105
00:14:29,220  -->  00:14:36,540
Women always know who's the hottest girl, okay, they have their their sexual hierarchy very, very clear in their heads, okay.

106
00:14:37,140  -->  00:14:44,430
And so because of this because they are so clear as to you know, this is the hottest girl, this is the second hottest girl, the third, fourth, fifth,

107
00:14:44,640  -->  00:14:53,670
and they know exactly where they are in that hierarchy. When they know that you date a higher status girl than them, they want you more. Okay.

108
00:14:54,420  -->  00:15:04,529
And so a lot of times, they will try to suss out from you. What can Have a woman you usually date? You see? Yeah. And it'll be subtle.

109
00:15:04,589  -->  00:15:12,149
They'll ask you a little cues or what have you, and tried to figure out, you know, well, was he dating like, 10? Or was he dating like an eight?

110
00:15:12,449  -->  00:15:19,739
Because maybe she's like a nine just for the sake of argument, right? And so if you were dating a 10, before, then she'll want to date you.

111
00:15:20,219  -->  00:15:26,429
But if she figures out that you were dating, like an eight or a seven, she's not going to give you the time of day. No way. Of course not.

112
00:15:26,579  -->  00:15:35,249
Because that's how women work. Okay? They want the better guy, the guy who dated the 10. And so if you dated a seven or six, fuck you,

113
00:15:35,279  -->  00:15:45,779
you're not going to get with that girl who's a nine. No way. Because she's not going to be wanting to be with a guy like that. It's as simple as that,

114
00:15:45,989  -->  00:15:52,769
you know, you will have failed the compliance test. You see, of course, if it's clear that you've dated the 10, then you have no problem. Okay?

115
00:15:52,949  -->  00:16:01,529
And what's funny is that see, a lot of times you date the girl who's a 10, okay? And they know for a fact that you dated the 10.

116
00:16:01,799  -->  00:16:08,819
And they're not going to give you any shit test at all. Okay? Because if they know for a fact that you dated this girl who was a 10,

117
00:16:09,179  -->  00:16:15,419
and you dated her, it doesn't matter if it was like a week or a month or a year, but you dated her, you're no longer with her.

118
00:16:15,539  -->  00:16:20,879
The girl who is a nine is going to be thrilled to be dating you and she's not going to give you any shit test. Yeah,

119
00:16:21,059  -->  00:16:28,079
because she's going to know that she is reaching for somebody higher. She's going to know for a fact,

120
00:16:28,349  -->  00:16:34,919
because she will assume that the girl who was a 10 already gave you shit tests. You see, see,

121
00:16:34,979  -->  00:16:38,579
see a girl who knows that you are with somebody else who is better.

122
00:16:38,879  -->  00:16:46,229
She assumes that you already went through all the hoops of a normal shit test because all girls give shit test to guys, all of them.

123
00:16:46,259  -->  00:16:54,449
So if you're like Leo DiCaprio, right, where everybody knows where you are on the totem pole. Leo DiCaprio has probably never had a shit test.

124
00:16:54,479  -->  00:17:01,169
Not as an adult. No way because everybody knows who he is. Right? So no girl in her right mind is going to shit test him. On the contrary,

125
00:17:01,169  -->  00:17:09,239
because he's such a high positions high status guy. Most girls are going to be fucking scared of him. Yeah, very scared of him.

126
00:17:09,719  -->  00:17:18,089
So if you really want to avoid shit tests, that's what you have to do. You have to create some sort of social proof.

127
00:17:18,539  -->  00:17:26,219
That is so obvious that no girl will dare to shit test you. This is of course, assuming that you're not good with shit tests, right?

128
00:17:26,849  -->  00:17:33,809
If you're not good with shit tests, then rather than try to get good at shit tests, you should have something that is so obvious,

129
00:17:33,809  -->  00:17:43,559
so untouchable that no girl in her right mind would dare to question it. And that's why so many guys get flashy cars. Yeah,

130
00:17:43,559  -->  00:17:48,029
because the flashy car like the Bentley or the Lamborghini or wherever the fuck whatever.

131
00:17:48,599  -->  00:17:55,979
vulgar piece of shit that they spent a boatload on automatically means that the guy's got means he's got a lot of money. Okay.

132
00:17:56,279  -->  00:18:02,009
And so a lot of times a lot of guys who are not very good with shit tests, what are they going to do? They're gonna get the expensive car,

133
00:18:02,039  -->  00:18:06,899
the really flashy car, the flashy car that is just like, you know, all bells and whistles, right?

134
00:18:07,049  -->  00:18:14,729
And that screams to everybody that he's got a shit ton of money. Yeah, that way. They avoid shit tests. But here's the thing.

135
00:18:14,759  -->  00:18:23,759
There are multiple shit tests, right? The lesser quality women are interested in the money shit test. Right?

136
00:18:24,119  -->  00:18:34,199
The higher quality women are interested in the brains shit test and the social proof shit test. Yeah. And see, that's why you know,

137
00:18:34,199  -->  00:18:44,009
you see a lot of these guys who are rich but stupid. they wind up with these over made up over dressed up. Women with the big boobs or the boobs.

138
00:18:44,009  -->  00:18:49,319
They're just shoved in your face guy who are just like pathetic, right? I mean, those kinds of girls like trashy girls, right?

139
00:18:49,769  -->  00:18:58,619
Those guys who drive the Lamborghini wind up with the trashy girls. Yeah. Because the higher quality girls, right, the more decent girls.

140
00:18:58,829  -->  00:19:07,529
The brain year smarter girls. Yeah. They see a guy with the flashy car and they don't buy his brand bullshit. Yeah, because they know.

141
00:19:07,769  -->  00:19:14,580
They know that all he's got is money. But that's it. Same with the brainy stuff. See, guy who's really brainy. Presumably you for instance,

142
00:19:14,580  -->  00:19:22,350
you're really fucking brainy. And you show off how fucking smart you are. This works with the brain girls who don't give a shit about anything else.

143
00:19:22,410  -->  00:19:32,820
Right? The the nerdy girls the girls with glasses, right? They care about a really smart guy. But they are not necessarily the hottest girl. You see,

144
00:19:33,210  -->  00:19:44,580
there are different kinds of girls will pay attention to different shit tests. And the other girls will ignore that guy. See? The really hot,

145
00:19:45,300  -->  00:19:53,280
dressed up girl, you know the model, for instance? She's not going to pay attention to the brainy guy. Okay, because she's gonna say correctly,

146
00:19:53,490  -->  00:20:02,340
that the brainy guy all he's got is brains, but he doesn't have money and he doesn't have social position. Fuck them. Yeah, yeah, that's how it works,

147
00:20:02,370  -->  00:20:08,340
what you want to be as an all rounder, you want to be an all rounder in the sense of, you know, being able to show a little bit of money,

148
00:20:08,370  -->  00:20:17,010
a little bit of brains a little bit of social position. And the fact that you've dated somebody of a woman of a higher status than the girl,

149
00:20:17,010  -->  00:20:27,240
you're after you want all four. Because if you focus on just one, you're going to get, essentially a distorted woman,

150
00:20:27,540  -->  00:20:36,120
a woman who prioritizes just one thing over the others. You see what I'm saying? Just like the guy who shows off the flashy car,

151
00:20:36,570  -->  00:20:44,520
and he's going to attract the bimbo. Right? who only cares about money, the gold digger who only cares about money. Yeah,

152
00:20:44,520  -->  00:20:53,220
and just as the brainy guy who shows off how smart he is, he's gonna attract the nerdy girl who is not particularly attractive, you know? The same,

153
00:20:53,220  -->  00:21:02,310
you see what I'm saying here, you're gonna attract a very narrow kind of girl, if you're only good with one kind of shit test.

154
00:21:02,460  -->  00:21:07,500
That's why you have to be good at all the shit tests, you know, see, I'm saying, once again,

155
00:21:07,500  -->  00:21:11,550
I'm sort of like not explaining what the fuck I'm trying to say. And I have notes and everything, you know,

156
00:21:11,550  -->  00:21:20,010
I, I try to think of this shit and prepare for the shin. You know, I start talking, I sound like a fucking retard, or the ideas I wrote down seemed,

157
00:21:20,130  -->  00:21:26,550
you know, better than they actually were word of the photo, you know, I'm just complaining. But anyway, the point I'm trying to make here is that see,

158
00:21:26,880  -->  00:21:33,750
you got to be an all around. And the only way to get good at chatez is to go out there, interact with a lot of women,

159
00:21:34,380  -->  00:21:40,440
and figure out what their priorities are. Okay? If that's the key ish, you figure out what their priority is,

160
00:21:40,680  -->  00:21:45,930
and they're going to test you on that thing. The gold digger is going to shit test you on how much money you have.

161
00:21:46,440  -->  00:21:53,040
The Brainiac girl is gonna you know should test you on how smart you are, how many books you've read shit like that. You know,

162
00:21:53,040  -->  00:22:02,730
the the social butterfly girl, she's gonna shit test you, in so far as you know, the social position and what parties you go to and shit like that.

163
00:22:02,910  -->  00:22:06,930
Right? And, and the girl who's competing with the other girls,

164
00:22:07,020  -->  00:22:13,950
she's going to shoot test you and try to figure out what quality of woman you are seeing is, each of them has a priority.

165
00:22:13,950  -->  00:22:21,870
And that's when you got to pay attention to what's the priority of the girl. That priority is the thing that she's going to test you on.

166
00:22:22,170  -->  00:22:30,360
And she's going to shit test you multiple times until she gets undeniable proof that you have that thing, okay. I mean, like,

167
00:22:30,750  -->  00:22:36,750
put into simple terms like, you know, insofar as a brainy girl, right? She wants to make sure that you're smart.

168
00:22:36,750  -->  00:22:43,950
And she'll have like brain teasers or ask you about obscure authors or shit like that, right? Something that you know,

169
00:22:43,980  -->  00:22:51,180
a dumbbell with a lot of money who's driving a Lamborghini, you know, he's gonna blow her off. He's not gonna know what the fuck she's talking about.

170
00:22:51,810  -->  00:22:58,020
You know it, she'll mention, you know, Richard Fineman or son, I, then he'll be like, Huh, you know, and instantly,

171
00:22:58,140  -->  00:23:07,710
he fucked up the shit test that she gave him. But you know, she'll do that relentlessly. Until she's absolutely sure. That's how it works.

172
00:23:08,040  -->  00:23:15,180
These shit tests, they don't go away. And they're constant. And you got to be prepared. You got to be prepared. And you got to recognize too,

173
00:23:15,180  -->  00:23:25,680
that it's not personal. She's not trying to shit on you. She's not trying to be nasty to you. On the contrary,

174
00:23:26,280  -->  00:23:37,140
a girl will only give a shit test to a guy that she is seriously considering. She won't waste her time with the guy that she does not take seriously.

175
00:23:37,530  -->  00:23:44,010
Yeah, I should test when you start getting shit tests from the girl. It means that you're on track with the girl. Okay?

176
00:23:44,580  -->  00:23:53,880
And that's why you have to prepare this shit. Don't think that you can just laugh it off some shit tests these shit tests. They're very, very serious.

177
00:23:54,630  -->  00:24:04,470
Because see, a girl will never really want you until you have passed the shit tests that she puts on you. Okay, so understand how crucial they are.

178
00:24:04,800  -->  00:24:13,470
But don't freak out about it. The way you have to handle them is with humor. Yeah, humor always wins and shit tests. Absolutely.

179
00:24:14,100  -->  00:24:21,300
You make a joke about the shit test. If because if you're really confident in whatever it is the quality that she's testing you for.

180
00:24:21,690  -->  00:24:30,750
If you're really confident that quality and you laugh it off laugh offer shit test or do the the the the meta thing of like,

181
00:24:30,780  -->  00:24:37,290
sort of like taking a step back and saying outright Oh, you're shit testing me on this thing? Okay, let's try it. Let's go, you know,

182
00:24:37,440  -->  00:24:48,900
and making a joke about it. That will earn you even more points. Because if you For instance, if you are talking with a brainy girl,

183
00:24:49,740  -->  00:24:58,560
and she starts asking you about Albert Einstein and Richard Fineman and quantum mechanics or some shit like that, and you openly say Oh,

184
00:24:58,560  -->  00:25:03,480
so you want to shit test To me and figure out if I'm a dumbbell or not okay, I can play this game.

185
00:25:03,480  -->  00:25:12,330
Let's talk about Richard Fineman or whatever the fuck, right? If you play it like that, instantly she will know that you passed it.

186
00:25:12,540  -->  00:25:21,780
Basically you do that move and you pass the shit test. Okay? Did it with the money thing, okay? girl says to us Oh, so what car do you drive us to?

187
00:25:21,780  -->  00:25:28,770
Oh, you want to? You want to see if I'm up to stuff that I'll drive you inside. Okay, I can play that game. But of course, the thing is here,

188
00:25:29,010  -->  00:25:38,970
when you do that with the money situation, for instance, you better be driving a fucking good car. Yeah. And ditto with the, the social proof.

189
00:25:39,030  -->  00:25:43,020
The one where we're, uh, you're in a good social company. See,

190
00:25:43,380  -->  00:25:51,510
you better know the people that she knows or know the people that she knows or know that people that she wants to know. Okay? I mean, you see, it's,

191
00:25:51,510  -->  00:25:59,100
it's a dangerous game. You can only do it. You can only pull off this shit. When you're really sure of yourself and you really have the goods.

192
00:25:59,430  -->  00:26:00,690
Because if you don't have the goods,

193
00:26:00,690  -->  00:26:01,620
you're going to look like a fool.
