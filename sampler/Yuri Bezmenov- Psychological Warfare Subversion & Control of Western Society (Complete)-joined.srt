1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,750
subversion is the term if you look in it in a dictionary or criminal code to that matter,

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:19,230
usually is explained as a part of activity to destroy things like religion, government system,

3
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,140
political or economical system of a country.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,650
And usually it's linked to espionage and such romantic things as blowing up bridges,

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,680
sidetracking trains, clock and Dagger activity in Hollywood style

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,670
when what I'm going to talk about now has absolutely nothing to do with the cliche of espionage

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,270
or KGB activity of collecting information.

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,480
So the greatest mistake or Miss Miss misconception, I think,

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,250
is that whenever we are talking about KGB for some strange reason,

10
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,700
starting from Hollywood movie makers to professors of political science,

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,360
and quote unquote experts on Soviet affairs or kremlinologists as they call themselves,

12
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,290
they think that the most desirable thing for

13
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,660
drop off and the whole KGB is to steal blueprints of some supersonic jet,

14
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,770
bring it back to the Soviet Union and sell it to the Soviet military industrial complex

15
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,410
is only partly true.

16
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,390
If we take the whole time, money

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:46,050
and manpower that the Soviet Union and KGB in particular spends outside of USSR border

18
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,450
will discover Of course,

19
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:55,290
there are no official statistics unlike with CIA or FBI that the Espionage as such

20
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:09,180
occupies only 10 to 15% of money, time and manpower 15% of the activity of KGB,

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,720
the rest 85% is always subversion.

22
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,640
And unlike a dictionary of English Oxford Dictionary,

23
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,700
subversion in Soviet terminology means all these destructive aggressive activity

24
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,630
a to destroy the country, nation or geographical area of your enemy.

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,490
So there is no romantics in there absolutely no blowing up bridges,

26
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,880
no microfilms and Coca Cola cans, nothing of that sort.

27
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,370
No James Bond nonsense.

28
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,960
It's most of the This activity is overt,

29
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,310
legitimate and easily observable if you give yourself time and trouble to observe it.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,720
But according to the law, and law enforcement systems of the Western civilization,

31
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,990
it's not a crime, exactly because of misconception, manipulation of terms

32
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,390
within that subverting is a person who is going to blow up our beautiful bridges.

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,980
No.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,030
So verter is a student who come for exchange a diplomat, an actor, an artist, a journalist,

35
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,580
like myself, was 10 years ago.

36
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:36,960
Now, subversion is an activity, which is a two way traffic.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,060
You cannot subvert an enemy, which doesn't want to be subverted.

38
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,000
If you know history of Japan, for example, default till 20th century Japan was a closed society.

39
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,380
The moment of foreign boats comes to the shores of Japan,

40
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,520
the Imperial Japanese Army politely tell them to get lost.

41
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,650
And the American salesman comes to the shore of Japan, let's say 60 or 70 years from now that

42
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,680
and says oh, I have a very beautiful vacuum cleaner for you know, the good financing.

43
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,130
Please leave us with the need your vacuum cleaner.

44
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,140
If they don't leave, they should come to preserve their culture, ideology, traditions,

45
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,300
values impact.

46
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,130
You were not able to subvert Japan.

47
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,530
You cannot subvert Soviet Union.

48
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,300
Because the borders are closed.

49
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,120
The media is censored by the government.

50
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,560
The population is controlled by the KGB and internal police.

51
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,250
But all the beautiful glossy pictures of Time Magazine,

52
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,770
and there is an American which is published by the American Embassy in Moscow.

53
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,710
You can not subvert Soviet citizens because the magazine never reaches Soviet citizens.

54
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,090
Its collapse From the new stance and thrown to garbage can.

55
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,340
Subversion can be only successful when the initiator they act or the Act,

56
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,950
the agent of subversion has a responsive target.

57
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,530
It's a two way traffic.

58
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,640
United States is a receptive target of subversion.

59
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,810
There is no response similar to that one, from United States to the Soviet Union.

60
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,080
It stops halfway somewhere it never reaches here.

61
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,580
The theory of subversion goes all the way back to 1500 years ago,

62
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:52,440
the first human being who formulated the tactics of subversion was a Chinese philosopher,

63
00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:10,620
by the name of some to 3500 years BC was an advisor for several Imperial courts in ancient China.

64
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,400
And he said, after a long meditation,

65
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:23,100
that to implement for him to implement state policy in a warlike manner.

66
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,600
It's the most counterproductive, barbaric and inefficient to fight on a battlefield.

67
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:35,400
You know that war is continuation of state policy, right?

68
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,620
So if you want successfully to implement your state policy, and you start fighting,

69
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:48,690
this is the most idiotic way to do the highest art of warfare is not to fight at all.

70
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,400
But to subvert anything of value in the country of your enemy, until such time,

71
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,310
that the perception of reality of your enemy

72
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,750
is screwed up to such an extent that he does not perceive you as an enemy.

73
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:14,070
And that your system, your civilization and your ambitions, look to your enemy as an alternative,

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,180
if not desirable, then at least feasible.

75
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,840
Better read, and then there's the ultimate purpose.

76
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,880
The final stage of subversion,

77
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,960
after which you can simply take your enemy without a single shot being fired.

78
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,160
Subversion successful This is basically what subversion as you see,

79
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,360
not a single mentioning of blowing up bridges, of course, sons,

80
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,130
they did know about blowing up bridges, maybe they were not that many bridges at that time.

81
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,580
But the basics of subversion

82
00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:01,200
is being taught to every student of KGB school in USSR and to officers of military academies.

83
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,600
I'm not sure if the same author is included in the list of reading for American officers,

84
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,350
to say nothing about ordinary students of political science.

85
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,030
I had difficulty to find the translation of sunset in in the library of a university in

86
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,850
Toronto and later on here in Los Angeles.

87
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,010
But it's a it's a book which is not available, it is forced to every students in USA

88
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,630
every student who is who is thought to be dealing further in his future career with foreigners.

89
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:47,310
What's the version is basically it consists of four periods time wise,

90
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,410
if we start from here and go this way time right this is the beginning point.

91
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,590
The first stage of subversion is the process which is called basically demoralisation

92
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,990
says for itself what it is,

93
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:20,400
it thinks from say 15 to 20 years to demoralize a society wide by 15 or 20 years.

94
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:31,530
This is the time sufficient to educate one generation of students or children, one generation,

95
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,030
one lifetime span of a person a human being,

96
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:46,620
which is dedicated to study to shaping up the outlook ideology, personality, no more no less.

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,070
Usually it takes from 15 to 20 years.

98
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:58,350
Well that includes it includes influencing or by various methods infiltration

99
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,640
propaganda Methods direct contracts doesn't really matter.

100
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:10,200
I will describe them later of various areas where public opinion is formulated or shaped.

101
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:22,140
Religion, educational system, social life, administration, law enforcement system, military,

102
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:30,870
of course, and labor and employer relations, economy, okay,

103
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,750
five areas I will not write them down because we will not have enough space.

104
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,370
Some sometimes when I describe all the methods, students ask me question,

105
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,200
Are you sure this is the result of the Soviet influence?

106
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,520
Not necessarily.

107
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,270
You said that practical subversion, about which I'm talking is similar to the martial art,

108
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,980
the Japanese martial art.

109
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,980
If you're if some of you familiar with that tactic,

110
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,510
probably you will remember that if an enemy is bigger and heavier than yourself,

111
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,130
it will be very painful to resist his direct strike.

112
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,270
If a heavier person wants to strike me in the face,

113
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,980
it would be very naive and counterproductive to stop his blow.

114
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,730
The Chinese and Japanese

115
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,140
Judo art tells us what to do first to avoid the strike than to grab the fist

116
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,140
and continue this movement in the direction where it was before.

117
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:44,490
Right until the enemy crashes in the wall, you see, so what happens here?

118
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,320
The target country obviously does something wrong.

119
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,320
If it's a free democratic society, there are many different movements within the society.

120
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,850
There obviously in every society, there are people who are against the society,

121
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,100
there may be simple criminals ideological in disagreement with a with a state policy,

122
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,560
conscientious enemies, simply psychotic personalities who are against anything.

123
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:23,280
But And finally, there are a small group of agents of a foreign nation, but subverted, precoded,

124
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,790
right.

125
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,690
The moment all these movements will be directed in one direction, right?

126
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,280
This is the time to catch the movement and to continue

127
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,700
until the movement forces the whole society into collapse into crisis.

128
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,060
Right.

129
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:45,090
So that's exactly the martial arts tactic.

130
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,410
We don't stop an enemy, we let him go we help him to go in the direction we want them to go.

131
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,990
And so on the stage of demoralization obviously,

132
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:04,890
there are tendencies in each society in each country, which are going to

133
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,640
opposite direction from the basic moral values and principles

134
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,070
to take advantage of these movements

135
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,530
to capitalize on them is the main purpose of the originator of subversion.

136
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,500
So we have religion, we have education, we have social life, we have power structure,

137
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:34,980
we have labor relations, unions and finally we have law and order 123456 Okay,

138
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,990
these are the areas of application of subversion, what it is exactly,

139
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,690
in case of religion destroyed, ridicule it, replace it with various sects, cults,

140
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,570
which bring people's attention, faith, whether it is naive, primitive, doesn't really matter.

141
00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:01,950
As long as the basically accepted religious dogma is being slowly eroded

142
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,920
and taken away from the supreme purpose of religion to keep people

143
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:14,640
in touch with with the Supreme Being that serves the purpose therefore, replays, accepted,

144
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,700
respected, religious organizations with fake organizations,

145
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:28,380
distract people attention from the real faith and attract them to various different faith

146
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,300
education.

147
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:37,110
This dragged them from learning something which is constructive, pragmatic, efficient,

148
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,240
instead of mathematics, physics, foreign languages, chemistry,

149
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:53,250
teach them history of urban warfare, natural foods, economy, your sexuality,

150
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,400
anything long as it takes you away.

151
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,020
Okay.

152
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,910
Social Life

153
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:07,530
Replace traditionally established institutions and organizations with fake organizations,

154
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,180
take away the initiative from people take away the responsibility

155
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,310
from naturally established links between

156
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,950
individuals group of individuals and society at large,

157
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,120
and replace them with artificially bureaucratically controlled bodies.

158
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:29,700
Instead of social life and friendship between neighbors, establish social workers,

159
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,600
institutions, people who are on payroll of whom?

160
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,770
Society No, eurocracy, the main concern of social workers is not your family, not you,

161
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,900
not social relations between groups of people,

162
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,340
the main concern is to get the paycheck from the government.

163
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,480
What will be the result of their social work doesn't really matter.

164
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,570
They can develop all kinds of concepts

165
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,300
to show them to show to the government and to the people that they're useful.

166
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,180
Okay, away from the natural links, power structure, okay.

167
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:14,640
The natural bodies of administration, which are traditionally either elected by,

168
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,650
by people at large or appointed by elected leaders of society,

169
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,430
are being actively substituted by artificial bodies.

170
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,320
The bodies of people, groups of people who nobody elected, never, as a matter of fact,

171
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,640
most of the people don't like them at all, and yet they exist.

172
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,690
One such group is media, who elected them?

173
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,270
How come?

174
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,340
How come they face?

175
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,030
They have so much power, almost monopolistic power on your mind, they can raise your mind.

176
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,440
But who elected them?

177
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,100
How come?

178
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,360
They are they have a nerve to decide what is good and what is bad for

179
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,090
for the elected by you president and his administration, who they alarming.

180
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:12,120
Spiro Agnew, who was hated by the liberal left, call them a bunch of enfeebled snobs.

181
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,250
And that's exactly what they are.

182
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:21,210
They think they know they don't say the level of mediocracy.

183
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,240
In a big establishment like New York Times, Los Angeles Times major television network,

184
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,820
you don't have to be excellent journalist.

185
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,040
You have to be exactly a mediocre journalist that's easier to survive.

186
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,420
There's not competition anymore.

187
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,370
You have your good, nice income $100,000 a year.

188
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,880
That's it, whether you're better or worse, doesn't really matter anymore.

189
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,630
As soon as you're smiling to the camera, and do your job.

190
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,870
That's it no more, no more competition.

191
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,750
Power structure slowly is eroded

192
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,990
by the bodies and groups of people who do not have neither qualification nor the will of people

193
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,790
to keep them in power.

194
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,410
And yet they do have power.

195
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,120
Okay.

196
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,730
Together with that there is another process.

197
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,010
Law enforcement law and order, organization and structure is being eroded.

198
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:25,800
For the last 2025 years, you you if you see all movies and new movies, you can see that in new movies,

199
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:33,330
a policeman, an officer of the United States Army looks dumb, angry, psychotic, paranoid,

200
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:42,540
a criminal looks nice kind of, well, he smokes hash and shoots the whatever drug but basically,

201
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,190
he's a nice human being.

202
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,690
He's creative.

203
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,830
And he's unproductive only because society oppressive,

204
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,380
whereby a general Pentagon is always by definition of a war maniac.

205
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,170
A policeman is a big road policeman, he abuses his power.

206
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,500
Not a generality, generalization, like the hatred,

207
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,420
the mistrust to the people who supposed to protect you,

208
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,780
and enforce law and order moral relativity.

209
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,400
The Angela Warner process last two years in Los Angeles, relativity.

210
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,030
The Angela Warner process lasted two years in Los Angeles.

211
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,650
And yet there are still some lawyers who say look, here's a nice character.

212
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,130
As a matter of fact, there was some witness was said also criminal.

213
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,610
For said, while he was a nice guy, I asked him one day to burn a house of my enemy and he wouldn't do it.

214
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,400
Slow substitution of basic moral principles

215
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:58,230
whereby a criminal is not a criminal actually is a defendant even if his guilt is proven.

216
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,970
There is to adult, to kill or not to feel to be or not to be die shall not kill Yes.

217
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,090
But this line may not necessarily be applicable to a murder,

218
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,640
they shall not murder that should be the presumption not not that they shall not kill.

219
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,360
Okay, Labor Relations at this stage within 15 to 30 years,

220
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:33,750
we destroy the traditionally established links of bargaining between employer and employee.

221
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,230
The classical Marxist Leninist theory of natural exchange of goods.

222
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,570
A person A has five sacks of grain and Person B has five pairs of shoes

223
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,840
of natural exchange without money is when they bargain between each other.

224
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:04,380
And only within production of the third foresee an entirely third foreign stranger who says no,

225
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,020
don't give him five sacks of bringing it to me.

226
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,730
And you give me your five pairs of shoes and I will distribute it accordingly.

227
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,820
So the economy will go.

228
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,240
This is the death of natural exchange that depth of natural bargaining.

229
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,510
Well, trade unions were established 100 years ago,

230
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,090
the objective was to improve working conditions and to protect the rights of workers

231
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,380
from those employers who are abusing their their right because they have more money.

232
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,960
Objective at that time, initially, the trade union movement did work.

233
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:51,540
What we see now is that the bargaining process is no longer resulting into in the compromise,

234
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:58,050
which is leading objectively to betterment of working conditions and increase of salary,

235
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,620
what we see is that after each prolonged strike, the workers lose.

236
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Even if they have a 10% increase of their salaries,

237
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,290
they cannot catch up due to inflation and due to miss time, more than that,

238
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,440
millions of people suffer from that strike.

239
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,340
Because economy now is interdependent.

240
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,770
It's intertwined like one body.

241
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,070
If previously, steel workers say 100 years ago could strike and nobody would suffer.

242
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,800
Now it's impossible anymore.

243
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,590
If a garbage collector strikes today, the rest of the multimillion city is stinking.

244
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,740
I mean that there is no more service.

245
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,830
In Quebec For example, we have the electricians who are on strike in the middle of winter.

246
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,030
You can freeze your bottom and base to work on strike.

247
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,450
Did they catch up with the Soviet bloc they lost?

248
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,060
Who benefited the leaders of trade unions?

249
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:03,330
What is the motivation for strike informing improving of work workers condition?

250
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,980
No, obviously it's not.

251
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,750
Then what is it? I do Logie to prove to these capitalists

252
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,200
and the obedient horde of workers like sheep follow these people and they cannot disobey Why?

253
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,190
Because if they do you know what happens to them tickets,

254
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,630
murders shooting truck drivers by picketers.

255
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,540
In Montreal, for example, I saw with my own eyes when I was correspondent of CBC international

256
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,190
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

257
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:43,140
When the work is of aircraft factory destroyed computers and the equipment in the factory and

258
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,830
the administration employed strikebreakers their cars were turned upside down and burned.

259
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,350
Their houses were burned,

260
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:58,440
their kids were intimidated and some victims were there of that can be sure why

261
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,930
to improve conditions of workers.

262
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,290
Now, ideology okay.

263
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:11,310
So, this is what happens basically, it may or may not happen without the help of the Soviet Union.

264
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,920
But the natural tendencies

265
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,370
are being greatly taken advantage of and capitalized by the Soviet propaganda systems how

266
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,610
whenever trade union strikes,

267
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,850
we have influx of propaganda mass media ideological dissemination to workers,

268
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:36,570
right and repeated like parrots, yes workers, right, whose rights workers know the only

269
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,460
freedom of workers to sell his labor according to his own design will

270
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:48,120
is taken away from him by whom, by trade union boss, unlimited power is given responsibility.

271
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,070
I want to sell my labor not for 250 an hour but for $2 I didn't have rights.

272
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,380
My freedom is denied to me. I know that if I sell my work for two for $2 an hour Not for $3 now,

273
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,850
I will compete better with it with the other guy who is lazy and more greedy.

274
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,760
I don't need to $3 I need only $2 No, I was made to believe by media,

275
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,380
by business by advertising agencies that I need more and more and more.

276
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,040
Have you ever heard any advertising on TV to consume less?

277
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,610
No, no wait.

278
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,970
Whether you need a six cylinder car or not, you have to buy it and hurry up.

279
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:40,050
When I was driving here on the local radio station unexcited announcer said, You hurry up,

280
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,620
rush and save, save save there is a plenty hoses sale?

281
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,230
Save by buying more?

282
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:59,040
Of course, of course, it would be too naive to expect the KGB mags that advertising agency

283
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,080
to do such a crazy commercial?

284
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,280
No, of course not.

285
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:10,440
But what we did when I was working for policy press, we would snow plow editorial offices,

286
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,180
student organizations, religious group with literature of class struggle,

287
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,320
may if not directly Marxist Leninist propaganda,

288
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:27,660
then a propaganda of over legitimate aspirations of working class, betterment of life equality,

289
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,090
equality mindview.

290
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,360
President Kennedy once said, people we will make America to believe that people are born equal,

291
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,370
are people born equal?

292
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:46,650
Is there any mentioning in the Bible or any other Holy Scripture in any religion, any religion,

293
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,480
if you don't believe me, go to library and check it.

294
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,990
There is not a single word about equality.

295
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,330
Just the opposite.

296
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,050
By your deeds, God will judge you.

297
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,450
What you do is important, the merit of your personality.

298
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,270
You cannot legislate the quality.

299
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,560
If you want to be equal, you have to be equal, you have to deserve it.

300
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,820
And yet we've built our society.

301
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,680
On the principle of equality, we say people are equal, we know it is false.

302
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,580
It's a lie.

303
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,420
Some people are tall and stupid.

304
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,790
Others are short, bold and clever.

305
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:52,680
If we make them if we make them equal by force, if we put the principle of equality,

306
00:27:53,070 --> 00:28:00,150
in the basis of our social political structure, is the same thing as building a house on sand.

307
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,390
Sooner or later, it will collapse.

308
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,920
And that's exactly what happens.

309
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,450
And we as Soviet propaganda makers are trying to

310
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,770
push you in the direction which you go yourself equality, yes,

311
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,940
equality people are equal land of equal opportunities.

312
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,670
Is it true or not?

313
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:27,450
Think about equal opportunities, should they be equal opportunity for me,

314
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,150
and for a lazy bastard who come here

315
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,940
from some other country and immediately registers as a welfare recipient benefits.

316
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,140
I never received a single note Sorry, I did this once.

317
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:48,150
But I never applied for welfare for the 13 years, I took any job, security guard, journalist,

318
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,770
taxi driver, anything.

319
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,220
While I was restless, but some people don't like it.

320
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,840
They immediate so why should we be Why should we have equal opportunities?

321
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,790
Why the Equal Opportunity to excel?

322
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,480
Equal Opportunity in equal circumstances?

323
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,940
Yes, but you know, people are different to excel.

324
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,480
Yes.

325
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,580
Provided we reach the same level of excellence See, perfection,

326
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,520
which is hypothetical distant future.

327
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,720
Yes, maybe.

328
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,830
But we know perfectly well that even with the best intentions, people could not be equal.

329
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,690
Why should we have equality in the same legal system, myself?

330
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,990
I'm considering myself a law abiding citizen.

331
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,570
And the person who comes here

332
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:48,270
to rob and shoot safe the United States administration on the card important

333
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,520
1000s of Cuban criminals.

334
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,890
They were non criminals.

335
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,140
Yet they were accepted.

336
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:02,790
Do you think it's fair if myself and my wife from Philippines who worked Like, excuse me, Horace,

337
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:09,420
as a lab technician in the hospital should have the same rights as a criminal film from Cuba.

338
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,320
And yet very Peters parents equality, equality, equality.

339
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,490
And

340
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,930
the solid propaganda system helps us to believe that equality is something which is desirable.

341
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,700
Democracy as it was established by fathers of this country of the system, and the last century, is,

342
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,770
is not equality is the system where different people

343
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,980
and equal people have a chance to survive and help each other in constant competition

344
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,690
in constant perfection, not inequality,

345
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:52,230
which is super imposed from from godfather or nice person in Washington, DC.

346
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,040
And the absolute equality exists in Soviet Union, quote unquote, equality.

347
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,980
Everybody is equally injured.

348
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,690
Except some people are more equal than the others in Politburo.

349
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,890
So the moment you you bring a country

350
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,320
to the point of almost total demoralization when nothing works anymore,

351
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,450
when you are not sure that there's right or wrong, good and bad.

352
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,540
But there's no division between evil and good.

353
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,870
When even the leaders of church sometimes say, well, violence for the sake of justice,

354
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:40,530
especially social justice is justified in the countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador, well,

355
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:41,760
maybe Rhodesia.

356
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,360
And we listen to them and say, Yeah, probably.

357
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,320
It's true.

358
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,100
Is it true?

359
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,570
No, it is not true.

360
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,040
Violence is not justified, especially for the sake of quote unquote,

361
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,100
social justice introduced by Marxist Leninist,

362
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:00,000
that this might form a call from novice Defense Agency.

363
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,530
Okay, so where is the point?

364
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,490
The next step?

365
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,900
Is this the realization?

366
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,420
Again, this word says for itself, what it is to destabilize all the relations,

367
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:22,200
all the accepted institutions, and organizations in a country of your enemy, how you do it.

368
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,450
You don't have to send up a battalion of KGB agents to blow up bridges.

369
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,360
No, you let them do it themselves.

370
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:38,280
The area of application is again, it's it's narrower now, not like the previous case.

371
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:46,470
The overt legitimate actions of the of the KGB in this case, would be hardly noticeable.

372
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:47,760
There is no crime

373
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:52,230
if a professor who recently went to USSR introduces a course of Marxism leninism.

374
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:59,070
In California, in college, for example, nobody is going to come to his doorstep and say, Okay, Mr.

375
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,110
Come, you're under arrest.

376
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,340
No, it's not a crime.

377
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,700
It's not even considered a moral crime against your country.

378
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,580
So the area of application here is narrowing down to economy.

379
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,310
Again, labor relations right.

380
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,470
To law and order.

381
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:28,110
Plus military and the economy is law and order.

382
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:28,680
Yes.

383
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,170
Again, the media but wider scope a little bit different.

384
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,390
I'll explain when Okay, basically precarious economy,

385
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,710
the radicalization of bargaining process, if on that stage,

386
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,950
we still could achieve theoretically some positive compromise between the

387
00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:02,010
negotiating sides with with say, the arbitrary introduction of arbitrary judges,

388
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,240
third side objective the judging the demands of both sides, here it's radicalization.

389
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:16,380
On this on the stage of this civilization, we cannot come to compromise even within a family,

390
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,650
the husband and wife couldn't figure out which is better.

391
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,370
Husband wants his kids to eat at the table and wife wants him child to roam around the room and,

392
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,620
and drop food all over the floor.

393
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,430
They cannot come to compromise unless they start a fight.

394
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,410
It's impossible to reach a compromise constructive compromise between neighbors.

395
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,410
Some people say I don't like you to watering

396
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:45,570
your lawn at that time because exactly at the time I'm walking my dog and he's getting nervous.

397
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,990
He cannot pass his balls, you know,

398
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,860
they cannot compromise they go to a civil court or something like that.

399
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,580
Radicalization of human relations.

400
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,070
Normal compromise, fight fight fight.

401
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,050
The normal traditionally accepted relations are destabilized

402
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:13,530
the relations between teachers and students in schools and colleges fight

403
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:21,900
the relations between in economical sphere between labors and employers are further

404
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,340
radicalized.

405
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,910
No more acceptance of the legitimacy of demands of workers.

406
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,080
Unlike Japanese, with the theory z if you ever heard about it,

407
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:38,460
where the workers are involved in decision making process therefore they don't have

408
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:45,090
moral incentive to fight their their bosses in the United States is just the opposite.

409
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,560
The harder is the fight the better the more heroic they look,

410
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,200
when the Greyhound network was on strike recently, the correspondence of local TV networks

411
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,380
all over the United States were approaching the strikers and they say oh, yes,

412
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,640
we are doing something nice.

413
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:13,140
They look like heroes and they were proud, there was some family the husband was a bus driver.

414
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,100
Now they decided in in the protest against the bosses to camp somewhere in the forest.

415
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,010
And they were presented to the to the audience as as a heroic nice people.

416
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,760
You see, the violent clashes between passengers picketers and the strikers

417
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:42,150
are presented as something normal 10 1520 years ago, we would we would be would be angry.

418
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,460
So why why why so much hatred.

419
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,640
Today we are not received well.

420
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,730
Commonplace, read radicalization.

421
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,230
Militarisation sometimes, as I explained, on that stage,

422
00:36:55,230 --> 00:37:04,440
I took a step a little bit further shooting people, okay, Law and Order now also is

423
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,490
pushed into the area where previously people settled their differences

424
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,830
peacefully and legitimately.

425
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:23,460
Now, we are getting rid this court cases in the in this smallest irrelevant cases,

426
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,920
we cannot solve our problems anymore.

427
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,780
The society at large becomes more and more antagonistic.

428
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,030
Between individuals within groups of individuals and the society at large.

429
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:46,080
The media puts himself in the opposition to the society in general at large, separate, alienated.

430
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,520
Okay.

431
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,870
On that stage, you remember, I was talking a couple of hours ago about the sleepers.

432
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:01,680
That's when the students from say United States, if they are training in the warmer University,

433
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,210
or developing nations,

434
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:09,480
that's the students I was dealing with are being sent back from the Soviet Union here,

435
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,750
or if they were already in the united states in the country, which is an object of subversion.

436
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,530
They spring to action, the sleepers go up.

437
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,850
They slept for 15 to 20 years.

438
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,130
Now they become leaders of groups, preachers.

439
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,630
I don't know, public public figures prominently they act they actively

440
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,360
include themselves in the political process.

441
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:47,100
All of a sudden we see a homosexual 15 years ago, he did his dirty job and nobody cared.

442
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:51,720
Now he makes it a political issue, a political issue.

443
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,380
He demands recognition, respect human rights,

444
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:01,710
and Iran is a large group of people and their violent clashes between him and police,

445
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:06,630
his group and ordinary people, no matter what it's black against white,

446
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,710
yellow is again green doesn't matter where his division line goes.

447
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:15,750
As long as this group come into antagonistic clash, sometimes militant, Li,

448
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,760
sometimes we fire arms.

449
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,700
That is this civilization process.

450
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:27,480
The sleepers, many of whom are simply KGB agents, become leaders

451
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,910
of the process of this civilization

452
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,380
doesn't mean the cameras on top of suns camera divano of the United States.

453
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,670
The person who takes care is already here is a respected citizen of the United States.

454
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:46,950
Sometimes he gets money from various foundations for for his legitimate

455
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:54,030
struggle for I don't know human rights women rights kid live, presumably whatever.

456
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,970
There are sympathetic Americans who donate their money to this the good life.

457
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,250
This sterilization process usually leads directly to the process of crisis.

458
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:20,250
In case of developing nations, there's the area where I was active, the process starts when,

459
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,790
when the legitimate bodies of power, the social structure collapses,

460
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,620
it cannot function anymore.

461
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,690
So, instead, we have artificials body injected into society such as non elected committees.

462
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:46,230
Remember, I was talking about them here, social workers, who are not elected by people media,

463
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:52,200
who self who are self appointed rulers of your opinion, some strange groups,

464
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,000
which claim that they know how to lead society forward,

465
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,720
they don't usually only cares how to collect the nations and,

466
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:06,810
and promote and sell their own concocted ideology, mixture of religion and ideology.

467
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:12,120
Here, we have all this artificials body claiming power.

468
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,920
If the power is denied to them, they take it by force.

469
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,680
In case of Iran, for example, all of a sudden, we have revolutionary committees,

470
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:27,390
who what what kind of revolution there was no revolution yet, and yet they had the committees.

471
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,330
They were taking power of judgment they have, they have the power of execution,

472
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:39,930
they had the power of legislation, and that they had the power of judicial,

473
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,830
all of them combined in one person who is half baked intellectual,

474
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,610
sometimes graduated from Harvard University or Berkeley.

475
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:51,090
He comes back to his country and

476
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,650
he thinks that he knows the answer to all the social economical problems.

477
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:03,600
Okay, crisis is when society cannot function any more productively it collapses, obviously,

478
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,130
that's the word for crisis.

479
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,160
So therefore, the population at large is looking for a savior.

480
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,480
The religious groups are expecting the Messiah to come.

481
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,600
The workers say we have family to feed.

482
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,870
Let's have a strong government, maybe socialist government centralized when when somebody put

483
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,500
put the employers on their place and

484
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,560
let us work we are sick and tired of going to strike and missing overtime and all that stuff.

485
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:41,970
We need some strong men strong government, a leader a Savior is needed.

486
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,340
Population is sick and tired already.

487
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,370
And here we are, we have a savior, either a foreign nation comes in,

488
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:57,480
or the local group of leftist Marxist no matter what they call themselves Sandinista

489
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,930
Reverend or some sort.

490
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,000
Bishop mozarella, like in Zimbabwe, doesn't matter.

491
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,930
A savior comes and says I will lead you.

492
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,030
So we have two alternatives here.

493
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,050
Civil War and invasion.

494
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,380
See how it goes.

495
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,970
Civil War we know what it is Lebanon is the is the best example.

496
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:37,680
The Civil War, which was artificially implanted in Lebanon by injection of force of PLO,

497
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,350
Palestinian Liberation Organization

498
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,980
invasion we have in many other countries like Afghanistan.

499
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:51,210
And then any East European country, it was invaded by the Soviet Army.

500
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:57,750
But the result is the same The next stage is normalization.

501
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,400
Normalization is a very ironic word of course.

502
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,510
It is borrowed from 1968 situation in Czechoslovakia when the Soviet propaganda

503
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,120
and after them New York Times declared the country is normalized, the tanks moved into Prague,

504
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,670
so there is no more Prague Spring, there is no more violence, normal normalization.

505
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:34,620
At that stage, the self appointed rulers of the society don't need any revolution anymore.

506
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,600
They don't need any radicalism anymore.

507
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,230
So this is the reverse from this civilization.

508
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:44,190
Basically, it is stabilizing the country by force.

509
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:50,190
So all this sleepers and activists and social workers and liberals

510
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,360
and homosexuals and professors and Marxist Leninist are being eliminated.

511
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,290
Physically, sometimes you They've done their job already.

512
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,450
Okay, they're not needed anymore.

513
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:12,840
The new rulers need stability to exploit the nation to exploit the country to take advantages

514
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,160
of the victory.

515
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,310
Okay, so no more evolution is plays.

516
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:20,340
And that's exactly what happens in number of countries.

517
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,240
You remember Bangladesh, this is the crisis in which I was instrumental.

518
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,980
First they had Mujibur Rahman.

519
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,440
In 1971, he was the leader of People's Party awami League.

520
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,300
With mustache like Stalin.

521
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,760
He was in Russia many times.

522
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,500
In five years, he was shot by his former colleagues, Marxists.

523
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,630
He fulfilled his function in Afghanistan, it happened three times.

524
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,380
Because there was turkey then there was a mean now there's Barbara karma,

525
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,480
they killed each other successively.

526
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,270
One after another, the moment he fulfills his duty, the first one demoralized country,

527
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:00,570
the second destabilize, the third one brought it to crisis.

528
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,980
Goodbye, Congress.

529
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:07,200
Barbara Carmel comes from Moscow and put them into the seat of power.

530
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,140
Same thing happened in Grenada recently.

531
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,370
Maurice Bishop, Marxist was killed by Austin,

532
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,310
what's his name general something was also a Marxist.

533
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:18,960
Right?

534
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,690
So no more revolutions please.

535
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,480
Normalization now, from now on.

536
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,200
Normal strikes normal homosexual sexuals.

537
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,160
Normal women lead normal kidlit normally period.

538
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,460
Good, solid, democratic proletarian freedom.

539
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:50,160
To reverse this process, takes enormous effort went today,

540
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:56,940
United States had to invade Grenada to reverse the process of subversion.

541
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,220
Some people say boy, this is not good.

542
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,210
It's not kosher, to invade the beautiful country island of Grenada.

543
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,200
Well, why didn't you stop the process here?

544
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,020
When Grenada was just approached by leftists?

545
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,390
Why not to prevent Maurice bishop to come in power in the first place did Grenadines want him

546
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,830
very questionable.

547
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,320
They didn't know who was more inspiration from the first place.

548
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,750
He came to power by coup d'etat himself.

549
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,710
Okay, now we let the situation develop further and further and further until the crisis

550
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,680
and normalization very soon.

551
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:36,480
And then United States decided to invade country discovering that

552
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,170
the country was absolutely a military base for the Soviet Union.

553
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,110
Of course, it's a drastic measure.

554
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:48,690
Of course, it's a pity that Marine Corps had to lose what 17 lines very bad,

555
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,260
why not to stop the process before it comes to prices,

556
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,570
or no intellectuals will not let you it's interference into into domestic affairs.

557
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,060
They're very careful not to not not to let American administration to interfere

558
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,400
in domestic affairs of Latin American caucus.

559
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,250
They don't mind Soviet Union interfere in this affair.

560
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:17,190
So to reverse this process, from here, it takes only and always military force,

561
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:21,600
no other force on earth can reverse this process at this point.

562
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,570
At this point, it does not take military invasion of the United States.

563
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:35,400
It takes strong action like in Chile as CIA covert involvement,

564
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,870
to prevent the Savior from outside to come into power

565
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:44,250
and to stabilize country before it erupts into civil war

566
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,150
country before it erupts into civil war.

567
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:55,920
Support the right wing conservative forces by money by crook so love doesn't matter

568
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,540
sterilized and don't let the crisis develop into into civil war or invasion

569
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,890
or no your liberals will say it's against the law.

570
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,780
The Congress will not appropriate money for covert actions.

571
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,880
So CIA Why not?

572
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,360
Should we wait till the normalization come in?

573
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,970
So good thanks landed in Los Angeles airport.

574
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,690
Now, at that point, at the point of this civilization also the process could be reversed

575
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:28,590
again easily then this no CIA involvement at this point.

576
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,870
You know, what it takes here?

577
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:39,240
Restriction of some liberties for small groups, which are self declared enemies of the society.

578
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,090
As simple as that all know,

579
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:45,510
the median liberals will tell you this is against the American Constitution.

580
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:56,040
How can we by force denied the civil rights to criminals for example, it's not good.

581
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:57,690
Okay.

582
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,790
So we allow them to okay.

583
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:04,470
If you Allow the criminals to have civil rights go on bring the country to the crisis.

584
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,050
This is a bloodless way to do curb the rights and not to put them in prison.

585
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:14,190
No, no, I'm not talking about putting all the gays from San Francisco in the concentration camp,

586
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:23,070
do not allow them to take political force, do not elect them to the seats of power,

587
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:27,240
whether it is municipality level, state level or federal level.

588
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:32,370
It has to be bitten in the hands of American voters,

589
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,570
at a person like that in the city of power is an enemy.

590
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,930
Do not be afraid of this word, it is an end.

591
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:43,080
If he is not an enemy here, he will be here.

592
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,020
Later on, he will be short of course.

593
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,650
But at this point, he is a man.

594
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,010
Okay, you're doing great service by denying him a right

595
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:06,630
to capitalize on his own crazy ideas and become a powerful man, a man who uses the seat of power.

596
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:13,740
Restriction of certain freedoms and permissiveness at that point, would prevent

597
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,650
sliding into crisis and probably will return the process of this civilization

598
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,110
to curb unlimited power,

599
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,900
monopolistic power of trade unions here at that point would say economy from collapsing,

600
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:37,020
to introduce a law to stop private companies of raping public opinions mine

601
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,200
in in the in the direction of consumerism,

602
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:51,870
no company must have a right to force you into buying more unless you want it must be a law.

603
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,230
You want to advertise your your car, okay.

604
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:00,330
But not a single mentioning of buying it now and saving money.

605
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:10,770
It must be against the law to force people to consume more self restrain.

606
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:19,140
Previously, before this process started, the self restrain was the business of church religion.

607
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:25,350
Because our preachers, the fathers of church will tell us material values are good,

608
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:29,310
but it's not the prime function of human being.

609
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,950
Because you have to leave them something.

610
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:40,140
Obviously the design for our life is not to consume more the audience is something greater.

611
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,970
It's such a complicated instrument the human body was created.

612
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,840
Obviously, there must be some higher purpose for that.

613
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,970
And it's very easy to avoid this civilization by denying

614
00:52:54,300 --> 00:53:00,420
the greedy companies one little freedom, one little Liberty forcing you

615
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:06,270
into turning yourself into processors of unwanted products and goods.

616
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:15,210
They turn you into machines like the warm who does inlet and outlet so

617
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:22,800
how long an average blinds lots of these days, less than a year?

618
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,520
Why?

619
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,650
Whereas workmanship we want you to buy?

620
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:36,150
Okay, this liberalization process could be easily overcome if as I say, the society,

621
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:44,670
by its own will or after persuasion by the leaders will come to the idea of self restrain.

622
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,960
It's so hard we want to consume more but you have to unless you will come to this stage.

623
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,580
When as we say in Russia, if Sahara Desert ever becomes a communist state,

624
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,290
there'll be shortage of sand.

625
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,950
You have to curve your

626
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:14,010
you have to you have to curve your expectations at this point before it's too late.

627
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,810
But no, we don't want to do it.

628
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,270
Demineralization process.

629
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,150
Again, it's the easiest thing to reverse.

630
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:31,140
First of all, by restricting import of propaganda, the easiest thing to do and limited,

631
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,410
unrestrained import of Soviet literature.

632
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,850
So the journalists

633
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:43,590
giving Soviet propaganda and ideological educators equal time on American TV networks.

634
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,990
It has to be stopped.

635
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,850
And it's easy.

636
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,040
They won't they won't be offended minded.

637
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,640
As a matter of fact, they will respect American war.

638
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,570
But then my former colleague Legendre Posner appears on nightline and said, quote, The Last Well,

639
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,460
what do you what do you think about this?

640
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:03,780
And what can he think?

641
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,120
He is an instrument of propaganda.

642
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:13,740
He thinks what what comrade Andropov tells us is just a nice articulate mouthpiece of the Soviet

643
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,510
subversion system.

644
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:21,720
And Ted Koppel makes you believe that my friend Vladimir Posner thinks,

645
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:37,530
the process of demoralization may not have started at all, if at that point, the country,

646
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,680
which is a recipient of subversion, actively, not violently,

647
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,820
but actively prevents importation of foreign ideology.

648
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,950
I don't want America to follow the pattern of ancient Japan,

649
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,250
you don't have to shoot every foreigner when it approaches

650
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,770
the sacred borders of the United States.

651
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:07,200
But when he offers you a junk in the disguise of very shiny, something, you have to tell him, No,

652
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,030
we have our own junk.

653
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,800
If at that point, the society is strong, brave,

654
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:29,070
and conscientious enough to stop importation of ideas which are foreign,

655
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,370
then the whole chain of events could be prevented.

656
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,870
Recently, I've been to Philippines, and I was shocked.

657
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:46,470
How in big cities like Manila, children listened to deafening music,

658
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:54,570
and melodious nation with long traditions of good, nice ethnic music.

659
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:00,510
Introduced by Spanish long time ago, maybe two centuries, three centuries ago,

660
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:04,200
I don't remember all of a sudden listen to musical garbage

661
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,780
blasting their radios at full blast of the full volume.

662
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,260
Why?

663
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:20,580
In India, I spent many years watching the reactions of Indians walking out of movie theaters,

664
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,190
after seeing Hollywood production.

665
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:30,240
They couldn't figure out why Americans are so wasteful, they smash their cars,

666
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,430
they shiny cars every five minutes.

667
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,150
How can they shoot each other for half million dollars?

668
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,330
Is the truth there?

669
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,830
So sex, sex?

670
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,530
I mean obsessed with sex?

671
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:51,240
Can you imagine showing a movie where each five minutes there is copulation on the screen?

672
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:58,230
So a country like India with long traditions, traditional of respect to this private matters?

673
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,970
For to Pakistan?

674
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,940
And United States expect these people to respect you?

675
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:07,950
No way?

676
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,820
Oh, yes, they will see the movie, they will pay five rupees to see that garbage.

677
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:18,240
But they walk out and will tell their kids don't respect Americans don't be like Americans.

678
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:19,590
See?

679
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:20,370
So.

680
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:29,820
The process of demoralization could be stopped right here, both as an expert and as an input.

681
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:33,120
And that takes one step.

682
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,370
One very important thing to do.

683
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,420
You don't have to expel all the KGB agents from Washington DC.

684
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:47,460
The most difficult and at the same time, the simplest answer to the subversion is to start here,

685
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:55,650
and even before by bringing back the society to religion,

686
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,670
something that you cannot touch and eat and put on yourself.

687
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,380
But something that rules society and makes it move and preserve it.

688
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,930
The Soviet scientists,

689
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,880
suffering which has nothing to do with religion is a computer scientists.

690
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,820
The very intensive research on the history of socialist countries.

691
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,310
He calls socialist or communist,

692
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:25,800
any country with a centralized economy and the pyramid will spiral of power structure.

693
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:32,700
And he discovered Actually, he didn't discover it he just brought to the attention of his readers

694
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:43,170
that civilizations like Maharaja Daro in the Premier Hindus area, like Egypt, like Maya Incas,

695
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,130
like below, but the lorgnette culture collapse and disappeared from the surface of

696
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:52,830
the moment they lost religion.

697
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,040
As simple as that they disintegrated.

698
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,770
Nobody remembers them anymore.

699
00:59:58,860 --> 00:59:59,760
Well, distantly.

700
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:12,090
So the ideas are moving society and keeping mankind as a society of human beings intelligent,

701
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:14,610
moral agents of God.

702
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,330
The facts, the truth, the exact knowledge may not

703
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:27,750
all the sophisticated technology and computers will not prevent society from disintegrating,

704
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,490
and eventually dying out.

705
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:37,440
Have you ever met a person who would sacrifice his life freedom for the truth like that?

706
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,350
This is truth.

707
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:50,970
I never met the person who said this is truth, and I'm ready to shoot me the truth.

708
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:58,170
But millions sacrificed their life, freedom, comfort,

709
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:07,470
everything for things like God like Jesus Christ,

710
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:13,500
it's an on some martyrs in the Soviet concentration camp died.

711
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:16,650
And they died in peace.

712
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:23,190
Unlike those who shouted long leave Stalin, knowing perfectly well that you may not live long.

713
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:35,460
Something which is something which is not material, moves society and helps it to survive.

714
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:38,550
And the other way around,

715
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:45,090
the moment we turn into two by two is four and make it the guiding principle of our life,

716
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:50,580
our existence, we die, even though this is true,

717
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:55,440
and this we cannot prove when we can feel and have faith.

718
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:02,100
So the answer to ideological subversion, strangely enough is very simple.

719
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,990
You don't have to shoot people.

720
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:04,740
You don't have

721
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:11,850
to aim missiles and Pershing's and cruise missiles at unbreakable headquarters.

722
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:17,370
You simply have to have faith and prevent suppression.

723
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,900
In other words, not to be a victim of subversion.

724
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:30,000
Don't try to be a person who in judo is trying to smash your enemy and being caught by your hand.

725
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,870
Don't strike like that.

726
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:37,590
Strike with power your spirit and moral superiority.

727
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,430
If you don't have the power, it's high time to develop it.

728
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,650
And that's the only answer
