00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,159
Welcome to the human lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,219 --> 00:00:05,789
where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,199
I'm Andrew Huberman,

4
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:14,249
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

5
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:19,049
Today, I have the pleasure of introducing the first guest of the Huberman lab podcast.

6
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:20,339
My guest is Dr.

7
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:21,449
Karl deisseroth.

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:22,289
Dr.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,299
Karl deisseroth, is a medical doctor.

10
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,319
He's a psychiatrist, and a research scientist at Stanford School of Medicine.

11
00:00:28,889 --> 00:00:33,539
In his clinical practice, he sees patients dealing with a range of nervous system disorders,

12
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,959
including obsessive compulsive disorder, autism, attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia,

13
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,859
mania, anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.

14
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,459
His laboratory develops and explores tools

15
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:51,719
with which to understand how the nervous system works in the healthy situation,

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,909
as well as in disorders of the mind.

17
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:54,449
Dr.

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,249
Dice Ross laboratory has pioneered the development and use of what are called channel options,

19
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,289
proteins that come from algae,

20
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,639
which can now be introduced to the nervous systems of animals and humans,

21
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,949
in order to precisely control the activity of neurons in the brain and body with the use of light.

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,609
This is a absolutely transformative technology,

23
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:19,439
because whereas certain drug treatments can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders,

24
00:01:19,499 --> 00:01:21,749
they often carry various side effects.

25
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,519
And in some individuals, often many individuals, these drug treatments simply do not work.

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,219
The channel options and their related technologies

27
00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:32,549
stand to transform the way that we treat psychiatric illness,

28
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,969
and various disorders of movement and perception.

29
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,649
In fact, just recently, the channel options were applied in a human patient

30
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,779
to allow an adult fully blind human being to see light for the very first time.

31
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,399
We also discuss Dr.

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,589
Dice Ross, newly released book, which is entitled projections, a story of human emotions.

33
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:55,139
This is an absolutely remarkable book

34
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:59,159
that uses stories about his interactions with his patients,

35
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:04,559
to teach you how the brain works in the healthy and disease state, and also reveals

36
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,989
the motivation for and discovery of

37
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:10,499
these channel options and other technologies by Karl's laboratory

38
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,719
that are being used now to treat various disorders of the nervous system, and that in the future,

39
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,699
are certain to transform the fields of psychiatry, mental health and health in general,

40
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,969
I found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one

41
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:29,459
about how the brain functions in the healthy state, and why and how it breaks down.

42
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:30,779
In disorders of the mind.

43
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:31,949
We also discuss

44
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,449
the current status and future of psychedelic treatments for psychiatric illness,

45
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,419
as well as for understanding how the brain works more generally,

46
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:41,729
we also discuss issues of consciousness.

47
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:45,059
And we even delve into how somebody like Carl,

48
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:50,009
who's managing a full time clinical practice and a 40 plus person laboratory,

49
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:55,589
and a family of five children and is happily married, how he organizes his internal landscape,

50
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:59,279
his own thinking, in order to manage that immense workload,

51
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,839
and to progress forward for the sake of medicine, and his pursuits and science.

52
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,469
I found this to be an incredible conversation I learned so much.

53
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,489
I also learned through the course of reading Karl's book projections

54
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:15,419
that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist, and obviously,

55
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,969
the complex research scientist and a family man,

56
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:22,289
but he's also a phenomenal writer projections is absolutely masterfully written,

57
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:26,789
it's just beautiful, and it's accessible to anybody, even if you don't have a science background.

58
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,709
So I hope that you'll enjoy my conversation with Karl deisseroth as much as I did,

59
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,179
and thank you for tuning in.

60
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,559
Before we begin, I

61
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:38,579
want to point out that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

62
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,829
In my desire and effort to bring zero

63
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,819
cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.

64
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,639
I'd like to acknowledge the sponsors of today's podcast.

65
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,799
Our first sponsor is Roca.

66
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:54,929
Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that in my opinion are the very highest quality out there.

67
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,379
The company was founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford,

68
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:03,299
and everything about the eyeglasses and sunglasses was developed with performance in mind.

69
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,419
One of the things I really love about Roca sunglasses,

70
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:11,609
is that unlike other sunglasses that make it hard to see when there's a lot of cloud cover,

71
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,319
or when the shadows change or environmental conditions change with Roca sunglasses,

72
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,749
they clearly understand the science of the visual system,

73
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,819
because when I put them on for the first time,

74
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:26,189
I noticed that as I moved into shadows or the cloud cover changed, or the day got brighter or dimmer,

75
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,349
everything was still crystal clear.

76
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:32,249
And that's also because the lenses are tremendously high optical clarity.

77
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,199
And the glasses are really lightweight.

78
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,029
You don't even notice that they're on.

79
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,769
The other thing is that the eyeglasses I wear readers at night, they're incredibly lightweight.

80
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:44,249
And for both the sunglasses and eyeglasses, the aesthetic is terrific.

81
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:47,369
Unlike a lot of performance eyewear, which frankly

82
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:51,509
can look kind of Cyborg like and kind of ridiculous the aesthetic of the glasses is such that

83
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,629
you could really wear them anywhere, indoors or outdoors.

84
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,869
If you'd like to try Roque eyeglasses, you can go to Roca.

85
00:04:57,869 --> 00:04:58,859
That's our okay.

Today's podcast is also brought to us by insidetracker.

89
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,769
Insidetracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

90
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,889
to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals.

91
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,009
I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.

92
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:28,769
And now with the advent of good genetic DNA tests, I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.

93
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,279
The

94
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,659
simple reason for this is that many of the factors that impact our immediate and long term health

95
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:37,349
can only be measured and evaluated with a quality blood test.

96
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,369
And now the DNA tests further inform our immediate and long term health.

97
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,849
One of the problems with a lot of DNA tests and blood tests out there,

98
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,869
however, is that you get the information back and you don't know what to do with that information.

99
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,159
With insidetracker.

100
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,699
You get the numbers back of different metabolic factors, hormones, etc.

101
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,009
But it also provides simple directives

102
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,849
as to how perhaps you might want to change your nutritional intake or your

103
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,399
exercise regimen or other lifestyle factors

104
00:06:02,549 --> 00:06:06,059
to bring those numbers into alignment with where you'd like them to be.

105
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,549
Insidetracker also makes this really easy.

106
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:11,459
They have a dashboard that makes organizing that all very simple,

107
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,539
and they can even have someone come to your house to take the blood and DNA test.

108

Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,

112
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:32,039
Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

113
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:35,459
I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,509
And I've taken ever since.

115
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,699
So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

116
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:40,799
The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,

117
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:45,659
and that I continue to take Athletic Greens is that it covers all my vitamin and mineral basis,

118
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,939
and it covers my probiotic needs.

119
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,949
There's now a wealth of data showing

120
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:54,629
that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome and that a healthy gut microbiome

121
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,939
supports the gut brain axis for healthy mood.

122
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:01,589
It also supports metabolism, immune function, endocrine, that means hormone function,

123
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,409
and a host of other important biological functions.

124
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:09,449
I drink it once or twice a day, I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice or some lime juice,

125
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:10,859
and it's absolutely delicious.

126
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,659
If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

127
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:18,269
you can go to Athletic Greens comm slash Huberman and if you do that, you can claim a special offer,

128
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:21,419
where they will give you a year supply of vitamin d3.

129
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,119
In addition, they'll give you five free travel packs.

130
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:29,789
Vitamin d3, as we all know, is very important for a huge range of biological functions and health.

131
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,779
Again, that's Athletic Greens, comm slash Huberman for your Athletic Greens,

132
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,019
the five free travel packs, and the year supply of vitamin d3.

133
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:39,539
And now my conversation with Dr.

134
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:40,919
Carl dicer off.

135
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,899
Well, thanks for being here.

136
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:43,799
Thanks for having me.

137
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,410
It's been a long time coming for me.

138
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,200
Because you may not know this,

139
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,880
but one of the reasons I started this podcast was actually so I could have this conversation.

140
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,150
It's it's but one, there are other reasons.

141
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:03,540
But one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations with colleagues of mine

142
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,690
that are doing incredible work in the realm of science.

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,190
And then here, we also have this really special opportunity because you're also a clinician,

144
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,140
you see patients and for a long time,

145
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,090
so for people that might not be so familiar with the fields of neuroscience, etc.

146
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,260
What is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?

147
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,700
Well, if you know I'm married to a neurologist, and I am a psychiatrist,

148
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,290
and we make fun of each other all the time.

149
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,010
So this is a lot of neuroscientists,

150
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,390
and a lot of brain clinicians actually think these two should be the same field.

151
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,130
At some point in the future.

152
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,140
They were in the past, they started together.

153
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:47,610
Psychiatry, though, focuses on disorders where we can't see something that's physically wrong,

154
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,290
where we don't have a measurable, there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis.

155
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,170
There's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia.

156
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
This is depression for an individual patient.

157
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,040
So psychiatry is is much more mysterious.

158
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:08,790
And the only tools we have are words, neurologists are fantastic physicians,

159
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:16,530
they see the stroke on brain scans, they see the seizure, and the pre seizure activity with an ECG.

160
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,990
And they can measure and treat based on those measurables.

161
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,390
In psychiatry, we have a harder job.

162
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,640
I think we use words.

163
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,920
We have rating scales for symptoms, we can measure depression and autism with rating scales,

164
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,540
but those are words still.

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,170
And ultimately, that's what psychiatry is built around.

166
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:44,070
It's, it's an odd situation because we've got the most complex, beautiful, mysterious,

167
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,300
incredibly engineered object in the universe.

168
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,240
And yet all we have are words to find our way in.

169
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,389
So do you find that if a patient is very verbal or hyper verbal,

170
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,379
that you have an easier time diagnosing them As opposed to somebody who's

171
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,629
more quiet and reserved, or it's, I could imagine the opposite might be true as well.

172
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,119
Well, it because we only have words, you put your finger on a key point, if they don't speak that much,

173
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:13,589
in principle, it's harder.

174
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,129
The lack of speech can be a symptom, we can see that in depression,

175
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:21,029
we can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, we can see that in autism,

176
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:24,869
sometimes by itself, that is a symptom of reduced speech.

177
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:29,849
But ultimately, you do need something you need some some words to help guide you in that.

178
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:34,979
In fact, there's there's challenges that I can tell you about where patients with depression,

179
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,199
who are so depressed, they can't speak.

180
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,229
That makes it a bit of a challenge to

181
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:43,559
distinguish depression from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking.

182
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:46,799
And this is a sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.

183
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:54,899
Do you find that there are patients that have, let's call them comorbidities or conditions where

184
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:58,049
they would land in both Psychiatry and Neurology,

185
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,369
meaning there's damage to a particular area of the brain and therefore they're depressed?

186
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,029
And how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist?

187
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,890
Yeah, this happens all the time.

188
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,170
Parkinson's disease is a great example.

189
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:17,910
It's, it's, it can be debilitating in so many ways people have trouble moving, have trouble walking,

190
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:24,660
trouble swallowing, and they can have truly severe depression.

191
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,820
And this is you might say, Oh, well, they've got a life threatening illness.

192
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,440
But there are plenty of neurological disorders where depression is not a strong,

193
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,930
strongly comorbid symptom, like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, for example,

194
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,680
depression is not as strong, strongly comorbid in that disease.

195
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,260
But in Parkinson's, it is extremely common.

196
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,380
And as you know, in Parkinson's disease,

197
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,310
we have loss of the dopamine neurons in the in the in the midbrain.

198
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,740
And this is a very, you know, specific population of cells that's dying.

199
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,660
And probably that leads to both the movement disorder and the depression.

200
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,840
There are many examples of that, where these two fields come together.

201
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:13,080
And he really needs work as a team, I've had patients in my clinic, that I I treat the depression

202
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,540
associated with their Parkinson's and a neurologist

203
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,260
treats the movement associated with the Parkinson's, and we work together,

204
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,720
do you think will you will ever have a blood test for depression or schizophrenia or autism?

205
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,870
And would that be a good or a bad thing?

206
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,279
I think ultimately, there will be quantitative tests.

207
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,609
Already, efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms in the brain using external e G's,

208
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,469
to look at brainwaves effectively,

209
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,459
look at the ratios of certain frequencies to other frequencies.

210
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,679
And there's some progress being made on that front, it's not as good as it could be, it doesn't

211
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,549
really give you the confidence for the individual patient that you would you would like,

212
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:59,099
but ultimately, what's going on in the brain in psychiatric diseases physical,

213
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:04,259
and it's due to the circuits and the connections and the projections in the brain that are

214
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,319
not working as they would in a typical situation.

215
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,029
And I do think we'll have those measurables at some point.

216
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,919
Now, is that good or bad?

217
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:15,899
You know, I think that will be good.

218
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:22,709
And one of the challenges we have with psychiatry as it is an art as well as a science to elicit

219
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,779
these symptoms, in a precise way does take some time.

220
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,869
And it would be great if we could just do a quick measurement.

221
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,859
Could it be abused or misused?

222
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:35,639
Certainly.

223
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,439
But that's, I think, true for all of medicine.

224
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,770
I want to know, and I'm sure there are several but

225
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:46,590
what do you see as the biggest challenge facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness?

226
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,340
Today?

227
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,909
I think we have, we're making progress on what the biggest challenge is,

228
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,959
which I think there's still such a strong stigma for psychiatric disease that

229
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,719
patients often don't come to us.

230
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:07,379
And they feel that they should be able to handle this on their own.

231
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:13,139
And that that can slow treatment, it can lead to, you know, worsening symptoms.

232
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:17,879
We know for example, patients who have untreated anxiety issues,

233
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:24,299
if you go for a year or more with a serious untreated anxiety issue that can convert to depression,

234
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:31,379
can you can add another problem on top of the anxiety and so it would be you know,

235
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,699
why do people not come for treatment,

236
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:38,219
they feel like this is something they should be able to master on their own, which which can be true,

237
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:42,479
but usually, some help is is is a good thing.

238
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,389
That raises a question related to something I heard you say many years ago at a lecture,

239
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:51,689
which was that this was a scientific lecture and he said,

240
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:54,689
you know, we don't know how other people feel.

241
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:55,439
Most of the time.

242
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,119
We don't even really know how we feel.

243
00:14:57,809 --> 00:14:59,699
Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit.

244
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:07,469
And The dearth of ways that we, we have to talk about feelings.

245
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:10,019
I mean, there's so many words, I don't know how many,

246
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:14,789
but I'm guessing they're more than a dozen words to describe the state that I call sadness.

247
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:19,949
But as far as I understand, we don't have any way of comparing that in a real objective sense.

248
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:26,519
So how, as a psychiatrist when your job is to use words to diagnose words of the patient to diagnose,

249
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:28,649
do you maneuver around that?

250
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,099
And what is this landscape that we call feelings or emotions?

251
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,309
This is really interesting.

252
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:36,479
People.

253
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,919
Here we have it, there's a tension between the words that we've built up in the clinic,

254
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,559
that mean something to the to the physicians,

255
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:47,249
and then there's the colloquial use of words that may not be the same.

256
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:53,399
And so that's the first level we have to sort out when someone says, you know, I'm depressed.

257
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:55,349
What exactly do they mean by that?

258
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:59,429
That may be different from from what we're talking about in terms of depression.

259
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:05,639
So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word, and to get into how they're actually feeling, get,

260
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:10,739
get rid of the the jargon and get to real world examples of how they're feeling.

261
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:16,649
So, you know, how do you what how much do you look forward into the future?

262
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,989
How much hope do you have?

263
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,969
How much planning are you doing for the future?

264
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:26,369
So these here, now you're getting into actual things you can talk about that are unambiguous,

265
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,179
someone says, Yeah, I can't even I can't even think about tomorrow,

266
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:33,449
I don't see how I'm going to get to tomorrow.

267
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,279
That that's a nice, precise thing that, you know, it's it's sad, it's tragic,

268
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,649
but but it's also that means something.

269
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,209
And we know what that means.

270
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,249
That's the hopelessness symptom of depression.

271
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,889
And, and that is what I try to do.

272
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:49,679
When I do a psychiatric interview, I try to get past the jargon,

273
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:52,859
and get to what's actually happening in the patient's life and in their mind.

274
00:16:53,339 --> 00:17:00,959
But as you say, ultimately, you know, this shows up across, I address this issue every day in my life,

275
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,179
whether it's in a lab where we're looking at animals, whether fish, or mice,

276
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:08,669
or rats and studying their behavior,

277
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:15,449
or when I'm in a conversation with just a friend or a colleague, or when I'm talking to a patient,

278
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:19,409
I never really know what's going on inside the mind of the other person.

279
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:26,609
I get, I get some feedback, I get words, I get behaviors, I get actions, but I never really know.

280
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:29,399
And as you said, at the very beginning of the question,

281
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,219
you know, often we don't even have the words and the insight

282
00:17:32,459 --> 00:17:34,589
to even understand what's going on in our own mind.

283
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,619
I think a lot of psychiatrists are pretty introspective.

284
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:40,079
That's part of the reason they end up in that specialty.

285
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,359
And so maybe we

286
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,559
spend a little more time than the average person thinking about what's going on with him.

287
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,629
But that doesn't mean we have answers.

288
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:55,650
So in this area of trying to figure out what's going on under the hood, through words,

289
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,220
sounds like certain words, would relate to this, this idea of anticipation and hope.

290
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,350
Is it fair to say that that somehow relates to the dopamine system in the sense that

291
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,350
dopamine is involved in motivated behaviors?

292
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,310
I mean, is that if I say, for instance, and I won't ask you to run a session with me here, for free?

293
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,500
We'll do that off camera guy, right?

294
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:28,830
If I were to say, you know, I, I just can't imagine that tomorrow, I just, I just can't do it.

295
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,110
So that's, that's not action based.

296
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,750
That's purely based on my my internal narrative.

297
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,420
But I could imagine things like, you know, I, I have a terrible time sleeping.

298
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm not hungry.

299
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,190
I'm not eating.

300
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,260
So it statements about physical actions, I'm guessing also have validity?

301
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:46,890
Absolutely.

302
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,810
And there are now ways to measure the accuracy of those statements.

303
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,770
Like for instance, if I gave you permission, you could know if I slept last night,

304
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,320
or whether or not I was just saying I had a poor night's sleep.

305
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,710
Yes.

306
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,460
That's right.

307
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,340
So in moving forward through 2021, and into the next 10 and 100 years of psychiatry,

308
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:14,130
do you think that the body reporting some of the actions of a human are going to become useful

309
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,600
and met mesh with the words in a way that's going to make your job easier?

310
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,950
I do think that's true.

311
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,590
And these are the two things you mentioned eating and sleeping.

312
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,880
Those are additional criteria that we use to diagnose depression.

313
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
These are the vegetative signs, we call them with depression, poor sleep and poor eating.

314
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,660
And if you have a baseline for somebody, that's the real challenge, though,

315
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,680
what's different in that person, some people with depressed they sleep more,

316
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,900
some people who are depressed, they sleep less.

317
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,880
Some people who are depressed, they're more physically agitated, and they move around more.

318
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,760
Some people who are depressed, they move less even while they're awake.

319
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,200
And so you need

320
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,870
to here's the challenge is you can't just look at how they are now you have to get a baseline

321
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,240
and then see how it's changed.

322
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,590
And that can be a challenge that raises You know, ethical issues?

323
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,700
And how do you how do you collect that baseline information from someone healthy, I don't,

324
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,950
I don't think that's something we have solved.

325
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,520
Of course, with phones and accelerometers and phones,

326
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,360
you could in principle collect a lot of baseline information from people.

327
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,090
But that would have to be treated very carefully for privacy reasons.

328
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,330
And in terms of measuring one's own behavior, you know, I have heard of work that's going on,

329
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,880
Sam golden up at the University of Washington,

330
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,620
works on aggression and animal models was telling me that there's some efforts that he's making,

331
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,110
and perhaps you're involved in this work as well, I don't know,

332
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,600
of devices that would allow people to detect, for instance,

333
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,630
when they're veering towards a depressive episode for themselves,

334
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,840
that they may choose or not choose to report that to their clinician,

335
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,830
maybe they don't even have a clinician, maybe this person that you referred to at the beginning,

336
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,740
this person who doesn't feel comfortable coming to talk to you,

337
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,870
they maybe something is measuring changes in the inflection of their voice,

338
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,510
or the speed at which they get up from a chair,

339
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,270
do you think that those kind of metrics will eventually inform somebody?

340
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,830
Hey, you know, you're in trouble.

341
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,420
This is getting to this question of

342
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,750
the back to the statement that I heard you make and wrong in my mind.

343
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,950
Now, I think for more than a decade, which is, oftentimes we don't even know how we feel.

344
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,050
Yeah, you know, that that I do like,

345
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:22,710
because that gives the patient the agency to detect what's going on.

346
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,310
And even separate from modern technology, this has been part of the

347
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:31,620
the art of psychiatry is to help patients realize that sometimes other people observing them,

348
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,410
can give them the earliest warning signs of depression, we see this very often and family,

349
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,580
they'll they'll notice when the patient is changing before the patient does.

350
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,890
And then there are things the patient may notice,

351
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,490
but not correctly ascribed to the onset of depression.

352
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,790
And a classic example of that is what we call early morning awakening.

353
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,260
And this is something that can happen very early, as people start to slide into depression,

354
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,670
they start to wake up earlier and earlier, you know, just inexplicably, they're awake.

355
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,060
This is like 2am 3am, awaken, it could start Yeah,

356
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,930
could start at 5am could go to four and unable to fall back asleep.

357
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:07,890
And they both fall back asleep.

358
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,490
Exactly.

359
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:12,990
So that's and that they may not know what to do with that it could just be

360
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,210
from their perspective is just something that's happening.

361
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,120
But if you put enough of that information together,

362
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,960
that that could be a useful warning sign for the patient, and it could help them seek treatment.

363
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,600
And I think that is something that could be really valuable.

364
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,470
Interesting.

365
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,760
So in this framework of you know,

366
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:35,640
needing words to self report or machines to detect how we feel or and maybe in form of

367
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,270
psychiatrist, how a patient feels want to

368
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,470
touch on some of the technologies that you've been involved in building.

369
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,860
But as a way to march into that.

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,140
Are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease?

371
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,560
Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions,

372
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,310
forms of communication that reliably work every time?

373
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,530
Or work in most patients?

374
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,400
And could you give a couple examples of great successes of psychiatry if they exist?

375
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:05,640
Yes.

376
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,730
Yeah, we are fortunate and this coming back to my,

377
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,260
you know, the joking between my wife and myself in terms of neurology and psychiatry, we actually,

378
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,580
in psychiatry,

379
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,250
despite the depths of our mystery we struggle with many of our treatments are actually,

380
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,690
you know, we're we may be doing better than some other specialties in terms of actually causing,

381
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,550
you know, the therapeutic benefit for patients.

382
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,070
We do help patients, you know, the patients who suffer from, by the way,

383
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,180
both medications and talk therapy has been shown to be extremely effective in many cases,

384
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:45,180
for example, people with panic disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words,

385
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,500
helping people identify the early signs when they're starting to move toward a panic attack,

386
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,570
what are the cognitions that are happening?

387
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:57,390
You can train people to derail that and you can very potently treating panic disorder that way,

388
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,400
how long does something like that take for on average, for a motivated, insightful patient,

389
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
you can have a very, you know, cookbook II series of sessions,

390
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,030
you know, six to 12 sessions or even lasted for someone who's very insightful and motivated,

391
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,400
and it can have a very powerful effect that quickly.

392
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,770
And that's just with words.

393
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,270
There are many psychiatric medications that are very effective for

394
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,640
the conditions that they're treating anti psychotic medications, they have side effects,

395
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,460
but boy, do they work, they really can clear up,

396
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,780
particularly the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, for example,

397
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,700
the auditory hallucinations that paranoia, people's lives can be turned around by these,

398
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,800
we should clarify positive symptoms you mean not positive in the in the qualitative sense?

399
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,590
You mean positive, meaning that the appearance of something abnormal?

400
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,750
Exactly, yeah, thank you for that clarification.

401
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,180
When we say positive symptoms, we do mean the

402
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,900
addition of something that wasn't there before like a hallucination or a paranoia.

403
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,140
And that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms where

404
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,550
something is taken away and these are Patients who are who are withdrawn,

405
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,220
they have what we call thought blocking,

406
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,250
they can't even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts.

407
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,800
Both of those can be part of schizophrenia, the the hallucinations,

408
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,340
and the paranoia are more effectively treated right now, but they are effectively treated.

409
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,910
And then, you know, this is a frustrating, and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry,

410
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,270
there are treatments like electro convulsive electroconvulsive therapy,

411
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,140
which is where you know, it's extremely effective for depression,

412
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,290
we have patients who nothing else works for them, where they can't tolerate medications.

413
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,890
And

414
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:44,580
you can administer under very safe controlled condition where the patient's body is not moving,

415
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,710
they're put into a very safe situation where the body doesn't move or sees it's just an internal

416
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
process that's triggered in the brain.

417
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,460
This is an extraordinarily effective treatment for treatment resistant depression.

418
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:02,820
At the same time, I find it as heartening as it is to see patients respond to this with with

419
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,620
who have severe depression.

420
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,540
I'm also frustrated by it Why Why can't we do something more precise than than this

421
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,190
for these very severe cases?

422
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,370
And people saw it for decades to understand,

423
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:19,050
how is it that a seizure is leading to the relief of depression?

424
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,890
And we don't know the answer yet, we would love to do that people are working hard on that.

425
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:28,080
But that is a treatment that does work to all in all these cases, though, in psychiatry,

426
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,660
the frustrating thing is that we don't have

427
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:35,880
the level of understanding that a cardiologist has and thinking about the heart,

428
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,180
you know, the heart is we now know it's a pump, it's pumping blood.

429
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:45,240
And so you can look at everything about how it's working, or not working in terms of that frame.

430
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,440
It's clearly a pump.

431
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,490
We don't really have that level of what what is the circuit really, therefore in psychiatry,

432
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,850
and that's, that's what is missing?

433
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,620
That's what we need to find.

434
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,920
So we can design truly effective and specific treatments.

435
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:08,100
So what do you what are the pieces that are going to be required to cure autism?

436
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,520
Cure Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia?

437
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,720
I would imagine, there are several elements and bins here.

438
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,420
Understanding that the natural biology understanding what the activity patterns are,

439
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,170
how to modify those, maybe you could just tell us what you think,

440
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,010
what is the the bento box of the perfect cure?

441
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,210
Yeah, I think the first thing we need is understanding we need we need

442
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,280
almost every psychiatric treatment has been serendipitously identified, just noting,

443
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,070
by chance that something that was done for some person also had a side effect,

444
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,560
like lithium or like lithium is as a good example.

445
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,880
Is it true that it was the

446
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,860
the urine of guinea pigs given lithium that was given to manic patients that made them not manic?

447
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,580
Is that true?

448
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,410
I don't have first hand knowledge of that.

449
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,490
But I would defer that, but it's true for essentially every treatment,

450
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:05,490
you know, the antidepressants originally, you know, roses, antituberculosis drugs, for example.

451
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:12,270
And so this is a classic example for, and this is across all of psychiatry.

452
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,410
And of course, there's the seizures as well, that was noticed that patients who had epilepsy,

453
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,280
they had a seizure there and also had depression that they became much

454
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,160
at least for a while they were improved after seizure.

455
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,210
That's amazing.

456
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
I don't want to take you off course.

457
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,210
So the question that answering the question I asked,

458
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,580
but I've heard before that if autistic children get a fever that their symptoms improve?

459
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,480
Is that true?

460
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,260
I've done a fair bit of work with autism.

461
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,200
In my clinical practice, I work with adult autism.

462
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,100
And I have heard

463
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,660
statements like that and descriptions like that from from patients and their families.

464
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:51,420
It's a it's that is very hard to study quantitatively, because often with the children,

465
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,050
you have this

466
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:59,430
not as quantitative as you'd like collection of symptom information from from from home.

467
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,450
But I have heard that enough that I think there may well be something to that.

468
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,940
And you know, what is anytime you have a fever, what's going on?

469
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,560
Well, we know all the cells in the brain, and I know this is an electrophysiologist.

470
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,550
If you just change the temperature by a few degrees, everything changes about how neurons work.

471
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,050
And that's even just a single neuron.

472
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,430
It's even more

473
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,840
likely to be complex and different with a circuit of neurons that are all affecting each other.

474
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,580
Just elevate the temperature a little bit.

475
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,600
Everything's different.

476
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,640
And so it's it's plausible for sure that things like that could happen and do happen.

477
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:33,780
Now.

478
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,560
But and yet, when you think about autism to take your example.

479
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,410
Yes, we see changes.

480
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:46,470
But what is the elements of the brain that's analogous to the pumping heart

481
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,170
when we think about the symptoms of depression?

482
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,430
That's maybe you know, we think about motivation and dopamine neurons.

483
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,120
When we think about autism, it's a little more challenging.

484
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:04,800
You had there's a deficit In social interaction and in communication.

485
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,260
And so where's that?

486
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,070
Where's this?

487
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,810
Where's that situated?

488
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,730
What is the key principle, governing the social interaction?

489
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,140
This is where we need the basic science to bring us a step forward.

490
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,810
So we can say, Okay, this is the process that's going on,

491
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,460
this is what's needed for the incredibly complex task of social interaction,

492
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,820
where you've got incredibly rich data streams of sound and meaning eye contact body movements,

493
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,430
and that's just for one person, or if there's a group of people,

494
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,880
this is overwhelming for people with with autism.

495
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,910
What's the what's the unifying theme there?

496
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,260
It's a lot of information.

497
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:48,510
And, and that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology,

498
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,970
the amount of information coming in through social interaction,

499
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,740
particularly with words and language.

500
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,420
And so then, that turns our attention as neuroscientists, we think,

501
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,210
okay, let's think about the parts of the brain that are involved in dealing with

502
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,670
merging complex data streams that are very high in bitrate that

503
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,700
need to be fused together into a unitary concept.

504
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,400
And that starts to guide us.

505
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,790
And maybe we can, and we know how other animals are social in their own way.

506
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:21,120
And we can study those animals and so that there's, that's how I think about it,

507
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,990
there's hope for the future, thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might,

508
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,580
and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working

509
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,920
to make this typical behavior happen, and that will help us understand how it becomes a typical.

510
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:40,350
So that seems like the first, to me the first been of this what I call the bento box,

511
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,170
for lack of a better analogy, that we need to know the circuits we need to know the cells

512
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,780
in the various brain regions and end portions of the body and, and how they connect to one another.

513
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,690
And what the patterns of activity are under a normal quote, unquote, healthy interaction.

514
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,110
If we understand that,

515
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:06,300
then it seems that the next step which of course can be carried out in parallel, right,

516
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,970
that though that work can be done alongside work,

517
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,740
where various elements within those circuits are tweaked just right,

518
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,170
like the tuning of a piano and the subtle white,

519
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,520
or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys, if the piano is lacking key, so to speak,

520
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,810
you've been very involved in trying to generate those tools.

521
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:36,000
So tell us about channel options, why you created them, and where they're at now, in the laboratory,

522
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,130
and perhaps also in the clinic?

523
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:43,980
Well, this is a first of all, I give nature, credit for creating channel adoptions.

524
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,590
These are beautiful little proteins that are made by algae, single celled green algae.

525
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:58,230
And it's a great story in basic science, that our understanding of animal behavior, sensation,

526
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:05,040
cognition and action in our brains, all the way back to a botanist in the 1850s.

527
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,250
And 1860s, in Russia, is where the story begins.

528
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:14,010
So this was a a botanist named Andre minsan, who worked at St.

529
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,730
Petersburg.

530
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:23,100
And he had noticed in the river near his laboratory that there were algae that he could look at,

531
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,350
in a ditch and a saucer, he could put them there and we had light shining from the side.

532
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,690
The green tinge in the saucer of water

533
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,050
would move to a particular distance from the light that he was shining from the side,

534
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,550
which was an amazing thing.

535
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,070
If he made the light brighter,

536
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,600
the green tinge would back off a little bit to a more optimal location.

537
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,830
So just the right light level.

538
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,380
So this was plant behavior.

539
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,660
It was light driven plant behavior.

540
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,680
And he delves into this a little bit, he identified that microscopy,

541
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,260
he could see that there were little single celled algae with flagella that were swimming to the,

542
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,250
to the right light level.

543
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,780
So behaving plants.

544
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:09,300
And this has been the secret that's that's helped us unlock

545
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,910
some of the principles of animal behavior.

546
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:19,740
So turns out, you know, these algae achieve this amazing results.

547
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:28,020
With a single gene that encodes a single protein, what's a protein, it's just a little biomolecule,

548
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,280
that does a job in a cell.

549
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,520
And these are proteins that sit in the surface of cells in their surface membrane.

550
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,920
And when a photon of light particle hits them, they open a little pore,

551
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:47,220
a little hole in the membrane and charge particles ions like sodium rush across the poor.

552
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,590
Now, why do they do that?

553
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,660
They do that to guide their flagella.

554
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,160
That signal coming in those ions coming in through the poor in response to light

555
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,250
guide their flagellar motor that guides them to particular spot in the saucer,

556
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:02,670
okay?

557
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,040
Now that's plant behavior.

558
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,810
But it turns out, as you know, this movement of ions across the membrane,

559
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,860
this happens to also be neural code in our brains for on or off sodium ions rushing into cells,

560
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,650
turns them on, make some Fire away,

561
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,520
fire action potentials communicate to the next cell down the chain.

562
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,870
And this is an amazing opportunity because we can borrow these proteins.

563
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,660
In fact, we can take the gene that directs the creation of the protein, and we can use genetic tricks,

564
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,150
modern genetic tricks to put that gene into neurons in the brains of mammals,

565
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,950
and then use light to turn those cells, the specific cells that we put this gene into, turn them on,

566
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,630
there are other options, we call them that you can use to turn cells off.

567
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,840
It's all fast, real time,

568
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,490
you can play in patterns of activity in real time into cells or kinds of cells,

569
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,900
just as a conductor elicits the music from the orchestra, the strings and the woodwinds.

570
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,240
And, and, and you can see what matters, what matters for sensation, what matters for cognition,

571
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,670
what matters for action, and we call this optogenetics.

572
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,950
Beautiful, and I must say, it was quite an honor and a privilege to watch

573
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:26,760
optogenetics move from idea to discovery to the laboratory,

574
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,800
I think we were postdocs at the same time,

575
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,310
which is living proof that people move at different rates.

576
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,210
That's a joke, at my expense, by the way.

577
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,060
But it's we live in the same spot.

578
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:48,390
Physically, if not professionally, but nonetheless, it's been a marvelous story thus far.

579
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:53,970
And I'd like to, maybe you could give us I'd like to just touch on a couple examples of where

580
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,820
the technology resides in laboratories now.

581
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,080
So maybe the range of animals that it's being used in and some of the phenomenon that

582
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,720
channel up chelmer, adoptions and,

583
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,690
and their related genes and proteins are starting to elicit what you've seen.

584
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,220
And then I'd like to talk about their applicability to the clinic,

585
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:22,229
which is, I think that the bigger mission, if you will, so this is, you know, this this whole thing,

586
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:22,679
you know,

587
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:28,109
it's been about now going on 17 years that we've been putting channeler adoptions into neurons,

588
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:33,509
it started just like Andre, for instance, work in a dish by 2000.

589
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:39,089
That was in 2004, and 2007, we were putting these into behaving mice, and we were able to,

590
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:45,869
with a click of a switch cause them to move one direction or another by 2009.

591
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:49,620
So basically, you're controlling the mouse's behavior, yeah, exactly in real time,

592
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,990
so we could make a mouse that was just sitting there doing nothing

593
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,980
to then turn left very consistently, in fact, go around in a circle.

594
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,610
And as soon as we turn off the light, it would stop, that was an eye opening moment.

595
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,680
It took really a few years to make optogenetics work,

596
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,140
there was a lot of putting all the there are a lot of problems that had to be solved these,

597
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,130
these channels, and options actually don't move many ions there,

598
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,100
they have a small current small conductance, as we say.

599
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,680
And so we had to figure out ways to pack a lot of them into cells without damaging cells,

600
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,140
and still make them targetable.

601
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,520
So we don't want to just be in all the cells because then that becomes just like an electrode,

602
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,230
you just didn't lighting all the cells that are nearby, we had to keep that specificity, make them

603
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,440
targetable to just one kind of cell or another

604
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,650
while still packing in large numbers of them into those cells.

605
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,470
And we had to get in the light and safe in specific ways.

606
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,160
And so it

607
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,860
took probably about four or five years to really create optogenetics between 2004 and 2009.

608
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,810
By the end of that time, though,

609
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:58,110
we had all the basic light delivery gene delivery principles worked out.

610
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:07,740
And people started to apply the technology to fish to rats to mice, to non human primates,

611
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,300
like monkeys.

612
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:18,240
And just a couple months ago, my colleague botond Raska in Switzerland, succeeded in putting

613
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,730
channeled options into the eyes of human beings and making a blind person and see

614
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,650
and so that's pretty cool.

615
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
This was a patient patient with retinal degeneration and he has

616
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,890
provided a channel for adoption into the eye of this patient

617
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,580
and was able to confer some light sensitivity onto this patient that wasn't there before.

618
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,530
An amazing paper and discovery.

619
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,720
I realized it was one patient but it's such an important milestone and well, it's it as you say,

620
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,110
it's a very important milestone and and the history of that is very deep, almost 10 years earlier.

621
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,130
Botond Roscoe and I had published a paper in science in human

622
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,700
retina but x plants and taken from cadavers from someone who Died living retina taking out

623
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,740
options put into this retinal tissue and showing that it

624
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,340
that it worked recording from the cells showing that in these human neurons,

625
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,220
retinal neurons that you could get light responses.

626
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:20,010
But then from that moment, you know, almost 10 years of you know how clinical development goes.

627
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,600
And this is a gene therapy.

628
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,260
So you've got

629
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:27,570
all the regulations and concerns and all that it took almost 10 years to get to this point,

630
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:32,070
now we're living human being has a new functionality that wasn't there before.

631
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,590
Now, that's incredibly inspiring,

632
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,010
you know.

633
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,310
And it's a, it's a beautiful thing.

634
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,060
I would say, though,

635
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:45,150
that the broader significance of optogenetics is really still understanding,

636
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,220
because once you understand how the circuitry works, in which cells actually matter,

637
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,550
then any kind of treatment becomes more grounded, and logical and specific and principled.

638
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,370
And whether it's medication or talk therapy,

639
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,970
or brain stimulation treatment with electrical or magnetic means,

640
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,180
if you actually know what matters, that is incredibly powerful, and I think, no, no,

641
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,660
you know, not intended to disparage this beautiful retinal work and conferring,

642
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,810
you know, vision on someone who couldn't see, of course, that's wonderful.

643
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,610
But that's direct, what you might call direct optogenetics.

644
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,060
And patients indirect is everything that comes from understanding,

645
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,690
you know, okay, we know these cells matter now, for this symptom, well,

646
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:35,520
how can we target those those cells and help them work better in patients by any means?

647
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,400
And I think that's the broader significance of optogenetics.

648
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,820
Clinically, you and I know both on well, and you embleton share this incredible,

649
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:50,130
big vision that I think only a clinician can really understand,

650
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,170
you know, being in close contact with and

651
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:57,660
the suffering of patients as a ultimate motivator of developing technologies,

652
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,760
which makes me have to ask,

653
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,180
did you decide to become a scientist to cure find cures for mental disease?

654
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,360
No, I didn't.

655
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,920
It's a it's a really important question to actually look back and see the steps that

656
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,470
brought you to a particular place.

657
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,320
And that was not what brought me initially to science and, and it's okay to, I think,

658
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,880
to embrace the twists and turns that life brings to you.

659
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,980
But I was always interested in the brain.

660
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:35,070
And so that was something that for me started from a very early age, I was,

661
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,870
you know, we talked about being introspective,

662
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,780
I noticed very early on, I had a deep love of poetry and stories.

663
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,420
And I was a voracious reader.

664
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:53,850
And I was amazed by how words could could make me feel in particular ways,

665
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,380
just even even separate from their, you know, of course, dictionary meanings,

666
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,310
the rhythm and how they work together, even separate from meaning.

667
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:07,740
And I was stunned by poets that could use words in new ways that

668
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,420
were even divorced from their meaning at all, and yet could still trigger specific emotions.

669
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,700
And I was, this was always fascinating to me.

670
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,590
So, you know, I wanted to understand that.

671
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,190
And so I was interested in I became interested in the brain.

672
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:26,070
And I thought, well, I'm going to have to study the human brain,

673
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:33,090
because only human beings can describe what's going on inside and off.

674
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:38,040
So in college, I began to steer myself toward medicine,

675
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,830
and with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.

676
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:48,090
And so I came here to medical school, and did an MD Ph.

677
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:48,210
D.

678
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:48,780
Program.

679
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:55,830
Planning neurosurgery all the way through the first rotation I did at the end of medical school,

680
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:59,070
as you know, you do rotations, you go through different specialties.

681
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:03,450
And some of these are required rotations, everybody has to do some elective where you can,

682
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,780
you can pick what you want to do. I elected to do neurosurgery first, even before regular surgery,

683
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,130
I was sure I wanted to do it.

684
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:17,580
And I loved it had a fantastic time, there was an amazing patient who had a flat damage.

685
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,160
And there was a neglect syndrome where the patient was not able to be aware of something that was

686
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,010
right in front of him, even though their vision was broken,

687
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,450
even though their vision was perfectly fine.

688
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:27,990
Exactly.

689
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,470
And so I was and I loved the operating room.

690
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:36,540
I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it and,

691
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,910
and I loved being able to help patients immediately.

692
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:47,610
But then a required rotation was in psychiatry, which I was not looking forward to at all.

693
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,930
And that completely reset my whole life that

694
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:57,330
that experience in psychiatry and it was it was that that that moment that I saw this is

695
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,560
first of all, the greatest need And the depth of suffering and the depth of the mystery together.

696
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,210
And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this.

697
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,530
It's so interesting to, you know, yes, yes, there's Yes, we can help.

698
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,790
Yes, there's need.

699
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:21,480
But as a scientist, this is amazing that someone's reality can be different from my own,

700
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,410
you know, with with everything, physically, as far as we can tell the same with the measures we have.

701
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,130
And yet we've got a different reality, that is an amazing thing.

702
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,960
And if we can understand that, and help these people, that would be just,

703
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,300
you know, more than anybody could ask for.

704
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:45,960
And so that's, that's how I ended up taking this path just to a required rotation in psychiatry.

705
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,700
It all started with poetry.

706
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,200
And it started with poetry.

707
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,900
Yeah, out of out of respect for poetry, or are there any favorites that you spend time with,

708
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:59,100
on a regular basis, I mean, the ones who,

709
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,770
who got me down this path early on, I remember and childhood in high school

710
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:12,780
board has had an immense influence on me. I studied Spanish all the way through and

711
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,040
reading his work.

712
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,580
He was a great writer, he wrote both in English and in Spanish,

713
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,070
and being able to appreciate his poetry,

714
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,830
both in English and in Spanish was was a pretty amazing thing.

715
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,370
Not many poets can can do that you're bilingual.

716
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:32,130
I'm not I wouldn't say now I became at one point, I was effectively fluent in Spanish.

717
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,530
And I have I'm pretty good with medical Spanish still,

718
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:38,850
because, you know, we use the Spanish all the time in the clinic here.

719
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,490
I wouldn't claim full fluency.

720
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,560
But it's something I can definitely use all the time.

721
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,750
That's been very helpful in the clinic.

722
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,860
Has this wonderful is the son of an Argentine I grew up hearing about it,

723
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,310
and I learned that board is favorite city was Geneva.

724
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:58,230
So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason, it's also turns out to be an interesting city.

725
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:08,670
So you developed methods to control neurons with these algae proteins using light.

726
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,540
In 2015, there was what I thought was a very nice article published in the New Yorker,

727
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:21,600
describing your work and the current state of your work in in the laboratory in the clinic,

728
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,580
and an interaction with a patient.

729
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,660
So this, as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed.

730
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:34,230
And you reported in that article, some of the discussion with this patient, and then in real time,

731
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,430
increase the activation of the so called Vegas nerve, this

732
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:43,170
10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull and integrates many of the viscera and body.

733
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:51,840
What is the potential for Channel read options, or related types of algae engineering,

734
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,360
to be used to manipulate the Vegas, because I believe in that instance,

735
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,270
it wasn't channel ops and stimulation was electrical stimulation, right?

736
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,620
Or to manipulate, for instance, a very small localized region of the brain,

737
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,840
let me frame it a little bit differently.

738
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,270
In light of what we were talking about a couple minutes ago.

739
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,950
My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression,

740
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,320
and they take any number of the available, pharmaceutical agents that are out there,

741
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:23,610
ss ra serotonergic, agents increase dopamine increase whatever,

742
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,140
that sometimes they experience relief, but they're often serious side effects.

743
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,940
Sometimes they don't experience relief.

744
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:34,980
But as I understand it, channel options and their related technology, in principle,

745
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,140
would allow you

746
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:43,380
to turn on or off the specific regions of the brain that lead to the depressive symptoms.

747
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,990
Or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit or an or a positive anticipation circuit.

748
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:53,970
Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology to

749
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,170
the nervous system and let's start with body and then move into the skull?

750
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,220
Yep.

751
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,460
So starting with the body is a good example because it it

752
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,300
highlights the opportunity and and how far we have to go.

753
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,750
So let's take this example of Vegas nerve stimulation.

754
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,470
So the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve that comes from the brain,

755
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:17,070
it goes down at innervates, the heart innervates the gut, and by innervate,

756
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,350
I mean, it sends little connections down to help

757
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,450
guide what happens in these these organs in the in the abdomen and chest.

758
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:28,500
It also collects information back and and

759
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,700
there's information coming back from all those organs that go also go through this vagus nerve,

760
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,320
the 10th cranial nerve back to the brain.

761
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:41,040
And so this is somewhat of a of a of a superhighway to the brain then it was the idea and maybe

762
00:49:41,070 --> 00:49:44,430
the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff a little electrical

763
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,670
device around the vagus nerve itself, and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery,

764
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:54,540
have a little power source here under the clavicle, everything under the skin

765
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:59,370
and have a little cuff and drive signals and maybe they'll get back to the brain.

766
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:03,660
So way Getting into the brain without putting something physical into the brain.

767
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,740
And why the Vegas?

768
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,810
I mean, it's there but and it's accessible.

769
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,530
That's the reason.

770
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,430
That's the reason.

771
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:08,910
That's the reason.

772
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:09,150
Yes.

773
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:09,660
Really?

774
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:09,900
Yeah.

775
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,650
You're not kidding.

776
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:11,310
I'm not kidding.

777
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:15,390
So stimulating the Vegas to treat depression simply because it's accessible.

778
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:20,820
It started as actually as an epilepsy treatment and can help with epilepsy.

779
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,520
But yes, somebody loves a medicine.

780
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:28,200
As a scientist I got this is where I get to chuckle and you say, I'm in the field of medicine,

781
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:33,150
it from that perspective, from from the perspective of a scientist and outsider

782
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,810
the field of medicine as a field that goes in and tickles pathways.

783
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,390
Because they're there.

784
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:42,480
It's I don't know what to say.

785
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,550
It's a little shocking.

786
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:44,820
Yeah.

787
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,030
And we'll at least in my laboratory, I always say

788
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,040
you never do an experiment because you can you do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.

789
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:56,220
Yeah.

790
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:56,610
Yeah.

791
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,190
I mean, we there are, there are stories people tell so that the salt the vagus nerve

792
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:05,940
lands on a particular spot in the brain called the solitary tract nucleus,

793
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,710
which is just one synapse away from the serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine.

794
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,610
So there's a link to chemical systems of the brain that make it a rational choice.

795
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,200
Yes, it's not it's not irrational.

796
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,610
But I can tell you that, even if that were not true, the same thing would have been tried.

797
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:20,850
Yeah.

798
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,760
You got you would have done it because it's accessible.

799
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:23,970
Yeah.

800
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,240
See?

801
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:24,750
Okay.

802
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,880
And, and but and, and why?

803
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:33,210
Well, it's, it's not again, not to disparage what's been happening in this branch of medicine.

804
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,350
There's immense suffering treatments, many treatments don't work.

805
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:43,020
And and we try things and and this is how so many advances in medicine happened.

806
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,900
You think about kidney dialysis, which has kept many people alive?

807
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,740
That that was just started by someone saying, hey, let's let's try this.

808
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,510
Maybe there's something building up in the blood?

809
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:54,180
Maybe we can dialyze something and help them yeah, it worked.

810
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,550
And it was just sort of a test pilot mentality.

811
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,160
We can we can access the blood.

812
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,610
Let's run it across a dialysis membrane, put it back in the body.

813
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,840
Oh, my God, that actually works.

814
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:09,150
And sometimes you do need that that test pilot mentality, of course, to do it in a in a rigorous,

815
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,920
safe controlled way, which is what we do.

816
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,620
And so anyway, that's how we we ended up with but but still with the vagus nerve stimulation.

817
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,550
Okay, so what is it?

818
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,570
Does it work?

819
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:24,090
It has it's FDA approved for depression, this vagus nerve stimulation,

820
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:29,880
but on the population level, if you average across all people, the effect sizes are pretty small.

821
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,520
Some patients it has an amazing effect.

822
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,200
And but some patients that doesn't work at all and average across everybody,

823
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,430
the effect size is pretty small.

824
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,360
How do you think it's working?

825
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,990
When it does work?

826
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:44,280
Is it triggering the activation of neurons that release more serotonin or dopamine?

827
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,880
It could be, but I would say we don't have evidence for that.

828
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,950
And so I just don't know.

829
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,280
But what is clear is that it's dose limited.

830
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,770
In how high and strongly we can stimulate and why it's because it's an electrode,

831
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,720
and it's stimulating everything nearby.

832
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,690
And when you turn on the vagus nerve stimulator,

833
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:09,000
the voice patient's voice becomes strangulated and hoarse, they can have trouble swallowing,

834
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,600
they can have trouble speaking, for sure, even some trouble breathing,

835
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,310
because everything in the neck,

836
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:18,540
every electrically responsive cell and projection in the neck is being

837
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,100
affected by this electrode.

838
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:25,020
And so you can go up just so far with the intensity, and then you have to stop.

839
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,630
So, you know, to your initial question Could a more precise stimulation method,

840
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,940
like optogenetics help in the setting?

841
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,860
In principle, it could because that would if you would target the light sensitivity

842
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,660
to just the right kind of cell.

843
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,940
Let's say cell x that goes from point A to point B that you know,

844
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,240
causes symptom relief of a particular kind, then you're in business,

845
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,150
you can have that be the only cell that's light sensitive,

846
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,460
you're not gonna affect any of the other cells,

847
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,090
the larynx and pharynx and productions passing through.

848
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,920
So that's the hope that's the opportunity.

849
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,910
The problem is that we don't yet have that level of specific knowledge.

850
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,840
We don't know.

851
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,770
Okay, it's the cell starting point A going to point B that

852
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,920
really use this particular so we want to fix this key on the piano.

853
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:14,970
And then I see two other steps that are required.

854
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,740
One is to get the channel opsin gene into the cell in the case of Baton Rosco and colleagues

855
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,630
rescuing vision in this patient.

856
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:27,570
They did that by an injection of a virus that doesn't damage the neurons.

857
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:29,460
The virus itself is fairly innocuous,

858
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,770
but carries a cargo and it's a one time injection the cells Express and then they

859
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,330
use light to stimulate.

860
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,930
So let's say I'm depressed,

861
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,840
which I don't think I am although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist,

862
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,690
you probably can see signs that maybe I am or maybe I'm not,

863
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:53,250
but let's say we put gentle opsin into my a specific branch of the Vegas that we understand

864
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,680
is responsible for mood.

865
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,930
How are we going to get it in there?

866
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,740
And then how are we going to deliver the Light because we're not talking about sunlight

867
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,900
or standing in front of a light bulb necessarily.

868
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,960
But what are what are the mechanisms for the body?

869
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,260
Yeah.

870
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:10,770
So we had to solve exactly these questions, you're saying, how do you get the light?

871
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,720
And how do you get the gene in, in a in a potent and robust and safe way.

872
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:23,550
And if that's now solved, and that's not a challenge, so there are very safe, well tolerated,

873
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,480
Gene delivery mechanisms that are called adeno associated viruses aavs.

874
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:35,760
And these are things that are associated with the common cold,

875
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,700
they themselves don't cause any symptoms.

876
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,380
They've been engineered.

877
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:44,670
And there's been a broad community of viral engineering that's been going on for decades,

878
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:47,790
making these safer, well tolerated, and so on,

879
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,780
we can put the channel rhodopsin gene into these viral vectors that deliver the the gene,

880
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,100
and we can have

881
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,780
little bits of additional DNA that govern expression only in one kind of cell but not another.

882
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,910
These are called promoters and enhancers,

883
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,280
all genetic tricks built up by a very broad community of great scientists over the decades,

884
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:13,590
we can put these different bits of DNA packaged them into this AAV, this little virus,

885
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,040
and that can be then injected into a particular part of the body.

886
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,710
And sticking with this Vegas nerve example.

887
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,590
We know that there are particular clumps of neurons,

888
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:32,010
there's one called the nodos ganglion that has a clump of cells related to the vagus nerve.

889
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,730
And you could for example, target a little injection into that ganglion,

890
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,620
would that be an outpatient procedure?

891
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,640
Yeah, yeah, to come in in the morning, get your injection, maybe walk out a few hours later.

892
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:42,480
Yeah, that's right.

893
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,660
And so that's the gene, then the light delivery, this is also something that we've worked out,

894
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,960
we worked on making very, very light sensitive options.

895
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:57,510
One challenge and botond would be the first to state this,

896
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,120
in fact, in solving this problem for the patient,

897
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,860
he had to build goggles that created much brighter,

898
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,730
much brighter light than normal ambient lighting delivery.

899
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,890
Because, as I mentioned earlier, you have to pack a lot of these general options in,

900
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,870
they don't have much current, you have to really make sure that you've got tense enough light,

901
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,040
to activate enough of them to cause a stimulation, and it has to be the right wavelength

902
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:28,440
has to be the right one going back to your example of the algae moving toward or away the light,

903
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,090
it has to be tuned just right.

904
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:37,500
So could you could I'm imagining in my mind, as a non engineer, I know you're also a bio engineer, the,

905
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:43,800
I'm imagining a little tiny, blue light emitting thing,

906
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:49,080
objects that are a little bigger than a clump of cells are maybe about the size of a clump of cells.

907
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:50,520
And for those who don't know,

908
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,030
you know,

909
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:58,770
your credit card is about 200 microns thick on the side and micron is a 1,000th of a millimeter.

910
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:02,130
And so we're talking about a little tiny stamp.

911
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:12,000
That's basically half a millimeter in size, all around each edge, half a millimeter in size.

912
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:18,270
I can imagine that being put under my skin, and then I would what I had an app on my phone and I'd say,

913
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:19,500
I'd say Dr.

914
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,220
Dicer off.

915
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,870
I'm not feeling great today.

916
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:25,680
Can I increase the stimulation and you say go for it, and then I ramp it up?

917
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,730
Is that how we go? I mean, that's effectively what we already do with the vagus nerve stimulation.

918
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,300
The doctor in this case, and I have this in some of my patients in the clinic,

919
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:37,410
I do vagus nerve stimulation, I talked to them, I say how I would go through the symptoms,

920
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,860
I use the psychiatric interview to elicit their internal states.

921
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:45,210
And then I have a radio frequency controller that I can dial in

922
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:46,800
right there in real time right there.

923
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,740
And you're holding the remote control to essentially to their brain,

924
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,200
although it's remote remote control through a couple steps.

925
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:52,890
Yeah, yeah.

926
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:58,020
And I can I can turn up, I can turn up the frequency, I can turn up the intensity,

927
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:05,190
all with the radio frequency and control and then it's reprogrammed, or re dosed.

928
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,700
And then the patient can can then leave at this altered dose.

929
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:09,810
So this is happening.

930
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:10,080
Now.

931
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,210
This is happening right now electrically, you do this routinely,

932
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,160
I do routinely in my clinic electrically, and you're getting the verbal content,

933
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:23,010
which as you described earlier, is the indication of how well something is working in real time.

934
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:24,300
So this what maybe you could

935
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,320
just describe a little bit of the interaction with that particular patient or another patient.

936
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:36,090
What's a typical arc of narrative, as you go from no stimulation to increase stimulation,

937
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,540
in most in most patients, the actual therapeutic effects,

938
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,870
the benefits actually take many days to weeks.

939
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:49,230
And so what I'm mostly focusing on in the office in real time is making sure I'm in a safe,

940
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,060
low side effect regime.

941
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,830
And so first I talk to the patient,

942
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:58,200
you know, how who has been on a particular dose of the stimulation for weeks or longer

943
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:02,730
and I talked about symptoms, how were things over the past month?

944
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:03,510
How is your hope?

945
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,520
How is your energy level asleep?

946
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,900
You know, how what is your mood.

947
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:12,240
And then we talked with the patient we decide this is this is not yet where we'd like to be.

948
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,740
And so then I can turn up the intensity of the stimulation, real time in the office,

949
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,700
I don't in most patients, I don't expect an immediate mood change.

950
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:28,110
What I do is I increase the dose until next level up while asking the patient for side effects.

951
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,130
Can you still breathe?

952
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,450
Okay, can you still swallow?

953
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,250
Okay, and I can hear their voice as well.

954
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,930
And I can guess they're looking at their face.

955
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:34,950
I'm looking at their face now.

956
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:42,210
And so I can get a sense is there a Mia Anna, still on the safe side effect regime and I and and then,

957
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,870
you know, I stopped at a particular point that looks safe.

958
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,440
And then patient goes home, comes back a month later,

959
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,870
and I get the report on how things were over that month.

960
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,920
I asked if you're looking at their face, because in your book,

961
01:00:57,030 --> 01:01:01,290
you describe the incredible complexity of social interactions.

962
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:08,790
And at one point, you described the incredible amount of information

963
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:14,940
that the eyes inform about the brain and the end the context of somebodies inner experience,

964
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:16,140
whether depressed or happier.

965
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,210
Otherwise, I want to make sure that we

966
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:24,420
get back to how to maneuver them and manipulate the nervous system for sake of mental health.

967
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,410
But what are you looking for?

968
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,150
So as a vision scientist, I think, you know, pupils dilating is a sign of arousal.

969
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:38,070
But that could be a positive arousal positive valence like excitement, or it could be terror,

970
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:40,380
you're gonna get the same dilation of the pupils.

971
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:46,410
And I'm always reminding people that these two little goodies are two pieces of brain basically,

972
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,910
they're just outside the cranial vault.

973
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:52,320
So they're not unlike the Vegas in that sense, but they're more of a report than a control knob,

974
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,710
although I like to think they could be used as control knobs to.

975
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,960
So without putting you on the spot, again, to diagnose me,

976
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,380
not something I would never ask you to do with the cameras rolling.

977
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:08,940
But what are you looking for, that the patient might not be aware of?

978
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,150
In other words, can you see depression in somebody's eyes?

979
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:19,020
And if you know a patient or if you don't, can you see it in their body posture when they walk in?

980
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,160
Realizing Of course, that a trained psychiatrist like yourself,

981
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,500
develops an intuitive sense that's aggregating lots of different features of a patient.

982
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:29,940
Yeah, but what about the eyes?

983
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,260
What's what's going on there?

984
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,590
Yeah, the eyes are incredibly rich in information.

985
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,560
And as, as you allude to, though,

986
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,450
it's not as if any one measurable conveys all the information you need.

987
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,680
It's what we, you know, what an engineer would say joint statistics, it's, it's,

988
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:51,690
it's many things all at once, whether they're in synchrony, or out of synchrony,

989
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,850
that that actually turns out to matter.

990
01:02:54,690 --> 01:03:00,150
And, you know, the eye contact question, we all know, eye contact is incredibly important,

991
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:04,320
you don't feel you've connected with somebody unless you unless there's eye contact,

992
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,300
and but eye contact can go awry, too.

993
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:12,300
It can be, it can be too intense, or it can be mis timed.

994
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,310
Or if there's someone with autism, it can be barely there at all.

995
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:25,530
And this is one of the most striking symptoms of autism is the avoidance of eye contact as if it's

996
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,560
almost as if it's a harmful quantity.

997
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,210
And so, there's an immense amount of information you can't you get from the eyes,

998
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,460
but it's it's the pairing of

999
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,200
what's going on in the eyes with everything else going on the body language,

1000
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,170
the what's the verbal content of what's what's coming out.

1001
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,260
All that together is is is the art of psychiatry and, and social interaction.

1002
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,140
But you know, sometimes you don't have the eye contact.

1003
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,310
And this is an amazing thing.

1004
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,540
And I do talk about this in the book as well, in many cases, you know, in psychiatry,

1005
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:04,020
sometimes it's over the phone that you have to make key decisions.

1006
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:09,810
And as a recall, you know, vividly being as a resident,

1007
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:17,010
very often you have to take these phone calls from people who are not in the hospital,

1008
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:21,210
people you can't see, can't see their eye can't see their body, anything about them,

1009
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:23,190
just the sound of their voice.

1010
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:28,350
And you can ask them questions, and you have to make, in some cases, life or death decisions,

1011
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:33,750
you know, is this person truly suicidal, something like that as it comes up all the time?

1012
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,800
And so I developed over the course of training.

1013
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:45,000
And I think, oh, all psychiatrists do this as you develop a way to whatever data stream you have,

1014
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,840
whether it's the eyes or whether it's just the sound of a voice coming over the phone.

1015
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:55,770
You want to hone in on that data stream you have and focus on it and identify changes and

1016
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,140
it's quite amazing.

1017
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:02,550
I found that you And actually, if you know a patient,

1018
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:09,390
you can detect very precise changes in mood just from the sound of the voice and and you can have a

1019
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,350
realization that oh, this patient's depression has improved,

1020
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:18,600
you know by by about half just by the tone of their of their voice.

1021
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,420
And same with eyes you can with enough practice,

1022
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:25,860
you can get in enough information from a single data stream to give you some information.

1023
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:29,160
But when you do have the whole picture that of course is best.

1024
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:35,850
So, so many theories out there about excessive blinking and lying,

1025
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:37,980
lack of blinking and sociopathy.

1026
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:43,620
I like to remind people that people have varying degrees of lubrication of the eyes,

1027
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:47,610
which also influence the frequency of blinking and presumably have nothing to do with

1028
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,310
whether or not what they're saying is true or not.

1029
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:56,520
But it's incredible nonetheless, that it's that the eyes are a portal to overall arousal state,

1030
01:05:56,550 --> 01:05:59,850
I'm fascinated by the effects of light on circadian biology and just overall

1031
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:02,490
desire to be awake or asleep, etc.

1032
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:09,990
So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault, the Vegas is outside the cranial vault,

1033
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,710
obviously.

1034
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,400
What about the goodies in here?

1035
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,190
Parkinson's, we know the

1036
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:22,200
at least one of the major sites of degeneration and failure that lead to those symptoms.

1037
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,960
I can name off any number of other things in your book, you talk about the beautiful work done with

1038
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,770
optogenetics

1039
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:32,880
of active versus passive coping that there are areas of the brain like the Banila that make

1040
01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:37,290
a when active make animals and presumably people passive and

1041
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:43,410
willing or uninterested in fighting back against pressures of life, whereas another region,

1042
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:49,560
the RAF a, you stimulate that, and then they actively cope, they, they get their grip going,

1043
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,330
and they and they are able to lean into life.

1044
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,030
So how do how does one get to those structures in a in a focused way?

1045
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:02,610
And what what are the next two to five to 10 years look like?

1046
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,400
Well, this is the this is the promise on that.

1047
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:10,710
And it is on a timescale that I think things may start to play out.

1048
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,250
You know that the specificity of optogenetics

1049
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:20,040
is really only useful if you have some idea of how to use that specificity.

1050
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,770
And it's an actually, it's a frustrating aspect of psychiatry that in many cases,

1051
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:30,660
the most effective treatments we have have the least specificity,

1052
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,800
electroconvulsive therapy being a great example, where you're causing a brain wide,

1053
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,650
which looks barbaric, but as you mentioned, is effective.

1054
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,900
I mean, it is it these days, it's much more clinically, you know, it doesn't look like one fluid.

1055
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,800
The last scene in Latin One Flew Over the Cuckoo's now it doesn't now it's a very clinically

1056
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:48,000
safe and stable procedure.

1057
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,470
But what were I I would say, yeah, it is it is good.

1058
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,290
It's got this almost medieval lack of

1059
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,760
specificity even if the procedure is well controlled and clinically safe and stable.

1060
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,230
And it has a it's not very specific, you're causing a brain wide seizure.

1061
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,060
How could you be less specific than that?

1062
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:08,940
And we don't know that the the source of the relief,

1063
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:12,570
we don't know it's a dump of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin,

1064
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:14,910
but we don't there certainly is a dump of neuromodulators.

1065
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:17,580
We don't know that that's the cause for the relief.

1066
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:21,960
And likewise, with medications, this is an also an interesting thing.

1067
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,130
So for some of the most effective antidepressants,

1068
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:30,720
some of the most effective anti psychotics are the ones that are have the most side effects.

1069
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,370
And many examples of this.

1070
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:36,510
For example, the most effective anti psychotic is something called closet teen,

1071
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:39,690
which has some questions has the most side effects.

1072
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:42,300
It had terrible, terrible size D for antagonists.

1073
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:44,340
It has basically every receptor.

1074
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,480
Does It Really?

1075
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:46,500
It acts interesting.

1076
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:52,770
Yeah, it has prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic certainly acts on dopamine receptors,

1077
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:59,220
but it causes, you know, blood blood cell counts, how do people feel?

1078
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:04,950
So if I'm, if I were schizophrenic, and I was getting auditory hallucinations, etc,

1079
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,420
and I took close pain?

1080
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,140
What could I expect to feel?

1081
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,600
Well, so you would notice

1082
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,730
side effects and you would notice resolution of symptoms both and so the voices would go away,

1083
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:21,090
but in a good situation, the voices would go away.

1084
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:21,390
That's right.

1085
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:26,250
But I would feel not good in my body, you would have you might have dizziness,

1086
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:31,470
you might have drooling, you might have any number of

1087
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:38,190
physical sensations that that would be due to these off target effects,

1088
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:40,440
the medication acting on these other receptors.

1089
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:41,789
And I'm certainly not suggesting this.

1090
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:44,339
But what if somebody without schizophrenia to close up been?

1091
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:46,949
They had the same side effects, presumably.

1092
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:50,519
And so it would not be something that that I would recommend,

1093
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:55,470
do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe, I just finished up for the third time.

1094
01:09:55,740 --> 01:10:01,470
Oliver Sacks his autobiography which is marvelous and and I highly recommend to people,

1095
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:10,050
he certainly took a lot of drugs, not as part of his professional role, but just out of curiosity,

1096
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:14,970
what is the interest or kind of role of, of drugs in the field of psychiatry,

1097
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,870
because for I would imagine for a group of very curious introspective people

1098
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,330
who are making recommendations about what to take,

1099
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:24,570
there could actually be some benefit for understanding what

1100
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,300
the experience of those drugs was like for their patients.

1101
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,860
I think that's that's true.

1102
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:32,700
And I will say that probably many or most psychiatrists have

1103
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:37,260
sampled a number of these for exactly the reason that you're saying is,

1104
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,080
is to understand better and to help treat their patients better.

1105
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:47,010
And I've I spoken to people who have, you know, really been, I found this very helpful to know,

1106
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:50,310
okay, this this sleep disruption caused by this medication

1107
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,950
or the libido disruption caused by this other medication?

1108
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,080
Wow, that is, that is a big effect.

1109
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,850
And it really helps with empathy for the for the patients to understand I'm not,

1110
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm not suggesting that physicians or anybody, experiment with drugs, but I,

1111
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:09,060
but I am relieved to hear that because I think that when you're talking about

1112
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:14,280
accessing somebody's mind, and their basic physiology, as you mentioned, relate to appetite,

1113
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,770
libido and sleep, you're really, you're really,

1114
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,750
one is acting as a mechanic of their the person's whole experience, they walk out of the office,

1115
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:25,800
and they have a life experience that extends beyond the script.

1116
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,340
Yeah.

1117
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,240
And so and yeah, and so that so at the same time, though,

1118
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,900
you can't let that completely guide your clinical decisions, because as I mentioned,

1119
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,830
some of these medications that have the most side effects, they are also the most effective.

1120
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:42,030
And cause pain is a great example that will work in patients where nothing else works.

1121
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:46,710
And believe me, we don't take the step of closet team prescription lightly,

1122
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:50,340
because of all these these side effects, you have to come in for a weekly blood cell,

1123
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:55,800
or every few weeks of blood cell check to make sure that the blood counts are not off, for example,

1124
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,880
but there are patients where no other medication works with schizophrenia and kloset.

1125
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,260
Being works amazingly well.

1126
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:05,280
And so we do it, even though there are side effects.

1127
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:09,450
And so then this comes back to your question, what if we had better and better specificity?

1128
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,960
Well, only if we know exactly what we're doing is the point.

1129
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,570
And so because as we become more refined, we better be right about where we're refining to.

1130
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,810
And you imagine a day where it will be a single,

1131
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:26,310
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery would go in through the scholar, the back of the year,

1132
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,400
deliver a small viral injection of one of these adenoviruses,

1133
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:36,150
a little sticker of light emitting diode, is that deep in the brain, is that how you envision this?

1134
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,710
That certainly could happen?

1135
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:46,470
What I what I actually prefer, as a vision is, is still medications, because those are,

1136
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,150
you know, minimally invasive.

1137
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:53,160
If we knew what we were doing, we could make them more specific, have fewer side effects.

1138
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:58,020
But optogenetics, that'll arm us with true causal understanding?

1139
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:59,130
And so we'll know.

1140
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:04,380
And we're already moving rapidly toward this point, well, no, okay, this symptom,

1141
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:11,040
the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhedonia, or the loss of motivation or,

1142
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:18,510
or energy to overcome challenges active coping, these are largely subserved,

1143
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,850
largely controlled by this circuit,

1144
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,970
or that circuit or the cell that's inhabits this other circuit.

1145
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,140
And we will know that because of the work done with channel Ops, exactly, yeah,

1146
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,950
I agree in ways that we never could have the confidence otherwise.

1147
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:37,710
And so we'll know that this is the circuit that that underlies the symptom, or its resolution.

1148
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:42,900
And then we'll get to understand these cells very deeply.

1149
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,750
Okay, these cells that are causal that do matter.

1150
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:47,010
Who are they?

1151
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,750
What do they what's their wiring?

1152
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,790
What are the proteins that they make?

1153
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,050
What are the little

1154
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:57,240
things that on the surface of the cell that could be receptors for specific medications,

1155
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:02,130
or combinations of receptors that would give us the specificity we need.

1156
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:07,380
And then armed with that causal and precise and rigorous knowledge,

1157
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,070
then you can imagine medication development becoming totally different,

1158
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:15,090
no longer serendipitous, but truly grounded in causality.

1159
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:15,780
I see.

1160
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,650
So using

1161
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:22,170
channel options as a way to probe the circuitry and figure out the sites that are disrupted,

1162
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,840
what patterns of activity are required.

1163
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:28,380
And then by understanding the constituents of those cells,

1164
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,640
like what they express and what they make, then developing drugs that could target those cells,

1165
01:14:32,790 --> 01:14:36,180
not necessarily putting light inducing diodes into the brain or

1166
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,660
walking around with wire packs attached our skull or something like that.

1167
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,030
That's fantastic.

1168
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:45,840
And and I realized no one has a crystal ball.

1169
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:50,310
But what do you think the arc of of that is?

1170
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:50,850
Meaning?

1171
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:56,310
Are we gonna see that in a year in two years, three years in, let me reframe that.

1172
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:03,570
If How soon will a pill Bay Treatment for a psychiatric disease be available that

1173
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,890
targets a specific set of cells that we know are important.

1174
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,190
Because of the work done with channel options,

1175
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:18,960
I think that is in some ways it's already happening at the level of individual patients.

1176
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,330
And here at Stanford, Yep.

1177
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:21,870
Yep.

1178
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:28,230
And, and more broadly, in terms of new new drugs, new, multicenter,

1179
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,100
you know, clinical trials that will play out over the next few years.

1180
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:38,910
And these could be drugs that are already safe and approved for other purposes.

1181
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:45,930
But we might say, Okay, now we know that this medication based on what we know,

1182
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:50,520
from causal optogenetics, this could be useful for this other purpose,

1183
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,900
this psychiatric symptom.

1184
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:58,470
And so the path to helping patients is to be relatively Swift.

1185
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,030
That's very exciting.

1186
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:06,720
What are your thoughts about brain machine interface and neural link always comes up,

1187
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,740
although I do want to point out at tremendous respect for the folks at neural link,

1188
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,710
including someone who came up through my lab is now there is a neurosurgeon,

1189
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:18,810
but the brain machine interface is something that's been happening for a long time.

1190
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:19,590
Now, some of the

1191
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:24,600
some of the best work among the best work being done here at Stanford and elsewhere to of course,

1192
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,760
I was the what you just described compatible with or different than brain machine interface,

1193
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,810
meaning devices,

1194
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:35,130
little probes are going to stimulate different patterns of activity and ensembles of neurons.

1195
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:40,110
And what are your general thoughts about brain machine interface as going forward?

1196
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:47,010
Now, I mean, at this is, first of all, it's an it's an amazing scientific discovery approach.

1197
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,040
As you mentioned, we and others here at Stanford are using

1198
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,090
electrodes collecting information from 10s of 1000s of neurons.

1199
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,240
In humans, I should add, and even Yes,

1200
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:01,260
there was there's that is quite even separate from the neural network.

1201
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:06,690
As you point out, many people have been doing this in humans, as well as in non human primates.

1202
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:11,760
And this is pretty powerful, it's important, this will let us

1203
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:18,090
understand what's going on in the brain in in psychiatric disease and neurological disease,

1204
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,980
and will give us ideas for treatment.

1205
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:29,610
It is, of course, it's still invasive, you still are talking about putting a device into the brain.

1206
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:36,780
And that it has to be treated as a as a situation that has some risks,

1207
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:39,270
and the step that has to be taken carefully.

1208
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:47,550
I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry, in the long run.

1209
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:51,030
Already, with deep brain stimulation approaches,

1210
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:54,000
we can help us people with psychiatric disorders.

1211
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:58,140
And that's putting just a single electrode, not even a complex,

1212
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:02,790
you know, closed loop system where you're both playing in and getting information back,

1213
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:08,910
even just a single stimulation electrode in the brain can help people with OCD, for example,

1214
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:09,960
quite powerfully.

1215
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,820
And that will become much more powerful when we get to a true brain machine interface,

1216
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:18,900
collecting information back stimulating only when you need to,

1217
01:18:18,930 --> 01:18:25,650
if we could identify a pathological activity pattern, a particular almost like the the prodrome,

1218
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:29,820
or the early stage of a seizure, and maybe there are events that happened leading up to,

1219
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:34,560
on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom,

1220
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:39,990
we could intervene in a closed loop way to detect what's happening, what's starting to go wrong,

1221
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,960
feed that back to the brain stimulation electrode,

1222
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:46,470
have it be in that way more efficient and more principled?

1223
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,340
This is, is I think, it's great.

1224
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:54,420
It's, it's something that, of course, will be grounded again, in causal understanding,

1225
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,540
we'll need to know what is that pathological pattern that we're detecting.

1226
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,920
And we need to know that it matters.

1227
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:02,730
And so again, that's where optogenetics is helping us and helping us know, okay, this,

1228
01:19:03,210 --> 01:19:05,640
this pattern of activity in these cells in these circuits,

1229
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:10,980
this does mean that there's a particular kind of symptom that's happening.

1230
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:14,190
But armed with that knowledge, absolutely.

1231
01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:16,530
Even the even a simple closed loop device,

1232
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:19,290
detect and stimulate is going to be part of psychiatry in the future.

1233
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:23,550
And then and then, of course, as you get to more cells, more connections,

1234
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,880
the ability that we have to help people will become more powerful.

1235
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:34,980
One of the questions I get asked a lot is about ADHD, and attention deficit of various kinds.

1236
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:41,100
I have the hunch that one reason I get asked so often is that people are feeling really

1237
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,860
distracted and challenged in funneling their attention and their behavior.

1238
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,820
But there are a number of reasons for that, of course,

1239
01:19:51,180 --> 01:20:00,390
but what is true ADHD and what does it look like what can be done for it and what if any role for Or

1240
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,050
channel options or these downstream technologies that you're developing?

1241
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,250
What are they?

1242
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,930
What do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD or have a family member that

1243
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:11,370
suffers from ADHD?

1244
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,770
This is a pretty interesting branch of psychiatry,

1245
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,950
there's no question that people have been helped by the the treatments,

1246
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,250
there's no active debate over

1247
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:29,760
what fraction of people who have these symptoms can or should be treated.

1248
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:33,720
This is typically Adderall or stimulants or some counter examples, stimulants.

1249
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:34,230
That's right.

1250
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:38,700
So ADHD, it's as its name suggests, it has symptoms,

1251
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:43,620
it can have either a hyperactive state or an inattentive state.

1252
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:48,060
And those can be completely separate from each other,

1253
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:53,100
you could have a patient who effectively is not hyperactive at all,

1254
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:57,060
but can't remain focused on the, the what's going on around them.

1255
01:20:57,060 --> 01:21:00,540
So their body can still but their their mind is darting around.

1256
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:03,510
That's right, or they can be very hyperactive with their body,

1257
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,110
it hasn't spoke probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body, but their mind is still,

1258
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:11,550
although I have to say and this is a benevolent shout out to Bhutan, Raska botond,

1259
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:14,640
he has an incredibly sharp and focused mind.

1260
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,970
And his hand movements are extremely exact also.

1261
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:19,440
So I do sometimes wonder

1262
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:24,090
whether or not our body movements in our head movements are whether or not their coordinator

1263
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,690
is or is a readout of how directed our attention is.

1264
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,940
I noticed I have to think complex abstract thoughts, I notice I have to be very still.

1265
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:39,570
So my body has to be almost completely unmoving, for me to think very abstractly, and deeply.

1266
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,590
Other people are different.

1267
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,780
Some people when they're running, they get their best thoughts.

1268
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,780
I can't even imagine that my brain does not work that way at all.

1269
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,860
I have to be totally emotional.

1270
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,810
Which is kind of interesting.

1271
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,860
How do you go about that?

1272
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,500
I said, much like this,

1273
01:21:52,530 --> 01:22:01,560
you know, I try to have time each day where I'm literally sitting almost in this in this position.

1274
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:04,110
But But without distraction and thinking.

1275
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:10,410
And so it's kind of a it's almost meditative in some ways, except it's not true meditation,

1276
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:13,560
but I am thinking while not moving, you're struggling.

1277
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,970
You're trying to structure your thoughts.

1278
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:15,150
Yeah.

1279
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:15,810
And that time, yeah.

1280
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,380
Interesting.

1281
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:16,770
Yeah.

1282
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,640
So but everybody, as you say, is very different.

1283
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,350
And so with with ADHD,

1284
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:28,020
you have the key thing is we want to make sure that this is present across different domains of

1285
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,180
life, school and home,

1286
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,650
to show that it really is a pervasive pattern and not something specific to Oh,

1287
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:37,200
you know, the teacher or the home situation or something.

1288
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,180
And then you can help patients.

1289
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:43,350
It's interesting that ADHD is one of those disorders where people are

1290
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:48,750
trying to work on quantitative eg based diagnoses and so there's some progress toward

1291
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:55,350
making a diagnosis with looking at particular externally detectable brainwave rhythms.

1292
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,290
So skullcap, some electrodes that don't penetrate the skull.

1293
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:58,620
That's right.

1294
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:01,620
And this can be done in an hour, two hour session.

1295
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,960
That's what it has to be done in clinic, right?

1296
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:04,920
Yeah, in the clinic, right.

1297
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:07,560
You have to have the right recording apparatus and so on.

1298
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:11,070
But, but but that's in principle,

1299
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,390
as you increasing confidence comes in exactly which measurements.

1300
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:21,300
One could even imagine moving toward, you know, home tests, but we're not there yet.

1301
01:23:22,410 --> 01:23:22,830
Amazing.

1302
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:27,420
I think one of the reasons I get asked about it so much is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD?

1303
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,170
Do you think that some of the lifestyle factors that

1304
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:37,530
inhabit us all these days could induce a subclinical or a clinical like,

1305
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:41,790
ADHD meaning if I look at people's phone use,

1306
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:47,100
including my own and I don't think of it like addiction, it looks to me and feels to be more like OCD.

1307
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:50,940
And I'll come clean here by saying when I was younger, when I was a kid, I had a grunting tick.

1308
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:55,260
I used to hide it actually used to hide in the closet because my dad would make me stop.

1309
01:23:55,710 --> 01:24:00,510
And I used to, I couldn't feel any relief of my mind until I would do this.

1310
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:04,920
And actually now if I get very tired, and if I've been pushing long hours, it'll come back.

1311
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,840
I was not treated for it.

1312
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,420
But I will confess

1313
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,820
that I've had the experience of I always liked sports where I involve a lot of impact, fortunately,

1314
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:18,270
not football, because I went to high school where the football team was terrible.

1315
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,070
Maybe that would have avoided more impact.

1316
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:24,240
But things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief.

1317
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,570
I feel clarity, laughter a head hit which I avoid,

1318
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,320
but but I used to say that's the only time I feel truly clear

1319
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:35,610
for a lot and then eventually it dissipated by about age 1617 just disappeared.

1320
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:40,290
Um, so I have great empathy for those that feel like

1321
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:44,040
there's something contained in them that won't allow them to focus on what they want to focus on.

1322
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,720
And these days with the phone and and all these emails, etc.

1323
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:53,610
I wonder and I empathize a bit when I hear people saying like,

1324
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:59,160
I think I might have ADHD or a DD Do you think it's possible that

1325
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:02,280
our behavior And our interaction with the sensory world,

1326
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,530
which is really what phones and email really are.

1327
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:07,620
Could induce add or reactivate it?

1328
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,439
Yeah, this is a great question.

1329
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:11,669
I think about it a lot.

1330
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:16,589
There's, you know, and you mentioned this this tick like behavior and yourself,

1331
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:18,929
it's very common that people who have

1332
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:23,369
tics have this building up of something that can only be relieved by executing the tick,

1333
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:27,779
which can be a motor movement or or vocalization or even a thought.

1334
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:33,899
And, and people do, I think these days do have this, if they haven't checked their phone.

1335
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:36,719
And while they do have a build up and build up a build up until they can,

1336
01:25:36,749 --> 01:25:37,859
they can check it and relieve it.

1337
01:25:38,609 --> 01:25:40,799
And there's some similarities,

1338
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:44,729
you know, there is a little reward that comes with with the checking.

1339
01:25:46,109 --> 01:25:51,779
But the key question in all of psychiatry, what we do is we don't diagnose something unless

1340
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:56,249
it's disrupting what we call social or occupational functioning,

1341
01:25:56,309 --> 01:25:59,189
like you could have any number of symptoms.

1342
01:25:59,189 --> 01:26:05,279
But literally every, every psychiatric diagnosis requires that it has to be disrupting

1343
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:07,919
someone's social or occupational functioning.

1344
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:11,039
And these days, you know, checking your phone is pretty adaptive,

1345
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:14,909
that pretty much helps your social and occupational functioning, and so we can't,

1346
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:18,779
we can't make and we can't make it a psychiatric diagnosis.

1347
01:26:18,779 --> 01:26:21,659
Interesting, at least in the world of today.

1348
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:27,840
Yeah, opting out of communication now makes it makes you in some ways, less adaptive, though,

1349
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:34,500
I would point to you as an example of somebody who is quite good at managing his interactions,

1350
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:39,360
at least from from the outsider perspective, I do want to ask you a little bit about you.

1351
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:47,610
And first of all, and I realize this is only a partial list, but your clinician, you see patients,

1352
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:50,490
you run a big laboratory, how many people are in your laboratory?

1353
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:50,820
Now?

1354
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,280
That's a huge laboratory.

1355
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:56,700
From experience, I can say that's, that's an enormous laboratory.

1356
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,720
You have a family of five children.

1357
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:06,270
And you're happily married to a wonderful colleague of ours as well, who does incredible work.

1358
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:15,570
How, how do you organize at a kind of conceptual level, the day in the week?

1359
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:21,660
And I should say, what stress mitigation practices, if any, do you incorporate?

1360
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,820
I've received emails from you at three in the morning.

1361
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:28,260
I sometimes send emails at three in the morning, but that's when I wake up, maybe I'm depressed.

1362
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:29,580
And but I go back to sleep.

1363
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:35,850
So maybe you just describe the arc of the blocks of the day, not hour by hour,

1364
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:38,250
necessarily the details of what are in those blocks.

1365
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,890
But how do you conceptualize the day?

1366
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,020
How do you conceptualize the weak?

1367
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:48,390
And how do you feel about how that's lined up with your,

1368
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:53,850
your larger goals of making sure these five young people, you know, flourish?

1369
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,990
Which I hear they are?

1370
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,050
But how do you go about this?

1371
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:02,010
What for most people would just be an overwhelming set of of items?

1372
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:08,370
Well, it's a, of course, it's sometimes it's just take it day by day.

1373
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:13,080
And and, and so I don't claim to bring the horizon into the unit of the day.

1374
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,310
I do.

1375
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:14,760
I do.

1376
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,110
It's it, the unit is the day.

1377
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:16,710
That's right.

1378
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:22,680
And what I, I try to have in each day, as I mentioned earlier,

1379
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:29,550
some at least an hour of time where I can think and that can be it can be when kids are napping,

1380
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:36,240
it can be you know, actually because I while driving, I can do that too, because I'm sitting still.

1381
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:42,180
But that that's the one thing I tried to preserve.

1382
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,000
When I was writing the book, I adapted that time to be my writing time, but it wasn't enough.

1383
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:56,190
It's you know, so I had to add in a new block of time, which was sort of midnight to 2am writing time.

1384
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:03,600
And, and so that carving out these even small protected times are very important.

1385
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:07,020
There's, of course, you know, obligations will

1386
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:11,820
will expand fill the time available and you have to be disciplined in my at least

1387
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:15,510
I found I had to be disciplined and in truly protecting those

1388
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,260
times where one can think so that means no phone.

1389
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,930
That means no phone, no checking of the phone.

1390
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:32,310
I would you know, when I was writing the book, I would I would have there's a focus mode on the MacBook,

1391
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,020
but that kind of

1392
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:40,350
ruins the border and you just have your your your documents and it's very pure and you don't have

1393
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:43,500
a temptation of distraction.

1394
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:45,060
I'm a big believer in

1395
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:49,740
because the vision and the eyes plays such a prominent role in directing our cognition,

1396
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:54,810
something you talk about in the book really beautifully and with a lot of depth and rigor

1397
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,410
using visual tools to harness one's Complete mental attention.

1398
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,420
When you do this practice of sitting and just thinking sitting still and thinking, you said,

1399
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,530
Your eyes are open?

1400
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:12,810
Are you hearing your own verbal voice, although in your head,

1401
01:30:12,990 --> 01:30:15,330
so you're actually in conversation with yourself?

1402
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:15,630
Yes.

1403
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:19,860
And hearing literally, I mean, not quite literal, I don't actually hear a foundation,

1404
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,480
but I am hearing words.

1405
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:27,030
And so it's, um, I discovered this about myself, other people, I think,

1406
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,610
you know, may operate differently,

1407
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:33,870
but I'm extremely verbal and how I think that's how all my reasoning is done.

1408
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:40,800
It's with sentences and construction of, of, you know, almost equations with words,

1409
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:45,780
complete sentences, complete sentences are complete ish, anyway, mostly complete.

1410
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:49,470
And then in when writing the book, everything about the writing,

1411
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:56,820
I would always every sentence was always played out, in my mind listening for rhythm and timing.

1412
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,160
And I would obsess over

1413
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:04,440
exact placement of words to get the right rhythm of the spoken sentence in my in my mind,

1414
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:06,360
I could I don't mean to interrupt your flow.

1415
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:11,490
But when you do that, and having experienced this process a bit, although differently,

1416
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:17,520
do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety when you're hitting the the friction points?

1417
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:23,910
And if so, do you have tools or ways that you quell that anxiety in real time,

1418
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,940
because what we're really talking about here is your mind.

1419
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,310
But what we're really talking about is this process of,

1420
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:36,000
of converting the activity of neurons into something physically concrete in the world.

1421
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:41,130
And these intermediate steps are so mysterious to everybody we hear, you know, just write the book,

1422
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,200
just do it, whatever that means.

1423
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,780
In fact, statements like that, to me are kind of empty and meaningless.

1424
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:51,570
But when you hear your voice, and you're trying to find the correct word,

1425
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:57,600
and you keep hitting the doesn't sound quite right, what is the experience in your body?

1426
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,970
Yeah, I went, it's not right.

1427
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,640
It's definitely it's versiv.

1428
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:04,860
It doesn't feel good.

1429
01:32:05,850 --> 01:32:06,630
But it's not.

1430
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:10,140
But I but there's also a hope, because I know I can solve it too.

1431
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:16,050
And, and so there's, there's this it's almost like you're you're almost there,

1432
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,450
you know, you've there's a path that you know, is there.

1433
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:20,340
You don't quite see it.

1434
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:22,410
But it's there.

1435
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,150
And and I keep that in mind.

1436
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:29,160
And so there's there's a there's a there's this propulsive force forward?

1437
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,500
Because I know that the solution is there.

1438
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:39,240
And and that said, I, you know, there were, there were single words that would, I would spend days on,

1439
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:42,360
you know, because I was just not happy until I got it right.

1440
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:45,420
And there were some things that I never quite got perfect.

1441
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:50,430
And so I left out of the book entirely, because it was so close, but not not quite there.

1442
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,740
And so I was like, No, I can't put that in.

1443
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,910
Everything you just said is entirely consistent with my experience of you.

1444
01:32:58,230 --> 01:32:59,520
And the way you go about

1445
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:05,160
everything I have to ask your kids writers do they like books and words and poetry.

1446
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:09,090
I know one of your children is going on to a career in medicine and science.

1447
01:33:09,179 --> 01:33:14,369
Yeah, they're each different, which is amazing, yet, they all I think do have some appreciation,

1448
01:33:14,429 --> 01:33:16,799
or a lot of appreciation for reading.

1449
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:21,809
But some are very musical two of the five are extremely musical very,

1450
01:33:21,809 --> 01:33:26,999
very talented with guitar and singing and vocal, you know, impressions.

1451
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:28,349
It's just astonishing.

1452
01:33:28,409 --> 01:33:30,299
And some of them are

1453
01:33:30,389 --> 01:33:36,719
great with drawing and artistry and some are very physical and vigorous and are never

1454
01:33:37,049 --> 01:33:38,069
happy except one,

1455
01:33:38,099 --> 01:33:42,449
you know, weeping about and so it's it's just amazing how different they are honestly,

1456
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:45,719
but but I think there is a shared appreciation for for language,

1457
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:51,870
do you think the that one can train their mind in using these practices,

1458
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:57,360
I really like your description of the sitting, staying physically still and,

1459
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:59,400
and learning to grapple with those.

1460
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:03,030
Those challenges that something that especially in laboratory science,

1461
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,010
we are really trained to do.

1462
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,970
Like many professions were taught to come in and just get into motion.

1463
01:34:09,090 --> 01:34:12,390
And and I found that very relaxing, and someone who probably has an underlying

1464
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:15,360
tech or something like that It felt great to be in motion.

1465
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,410
One of the hardest things about

1466
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:21,270
becoming a university professor and running a lab was that I no longer working with my hands.

1467
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:27,660
And I felt like I was I felt like some big important part of my life had been amputated.

1468
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:31,110
But what sorts of practices do you incorporate there?

1469
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:37,440
And do you think people can learn to get better at focusing through a dedicated practice

1470
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,670
of the sort that you described?

1471
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:42,540
I think, you know, that I also you know,

1472
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:51,330
I remember the rhythms of physical work in the laboratory very well, like I my work you know,

1473
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:57,030
these days as the laboratory leader, my job has returned mostly to words now again,

1474
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:59,280
and so it's it's kind of coming full circle.

1475
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:06,330
I was So it's a different mode, I think you just have to embrace that,

1476
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:09,240
that different stages of life come with with different modes,

1477
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,250
but you can definitely train yourself for each mode.

1478
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:22,380
I was not, you know, I loved the, as I mentioned the rhythm of sewing and suturing and surgery.

1479
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:27,390
And I worked really hard on that and became, you know, good at it.

1480
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,490
And now, I never do it.

1481
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,470
But it's what's the next challenge?

1482
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:35,040
You know, there's all the various experimental techniques, the dissections of the brain,

1483
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:40,020
you know, I can't tell you how many 1000s of brain dissections I've done in my life.

1484
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:41,100
And now I don't do them at all,

1485
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:44,790
it's and then you developed a method so that we don't have to does that grant, as you mentioned,

1486
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:47,430
that maybe tell us for a moment about clarity and for that,

1487
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:51,570
for people who will probably never set foot into a laboratory.

1488
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:58,560
What an incredible, yet another incredible discovery, discovery and development clarity is,

1489
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,100
and why it helps us understand how the brain is structured.

1490
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:06,870
So this is this is a different technology also developed in my lab here.

1491
01:36:06,900 --> 01:36:12,270
And it's part of a broader approach that we call hydrogen tissue chemistry.

1492
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:12,990
And what this is,

1493
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:21,420
is it's building a gel like a clear jello like substance with from within all the cells of a tissue,

1494
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,940
or even an animal all at once.

1495
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:28,140
So you're building, effectively building a gel inside all the cells at once.

1496
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,450
Now, that's a thing to do.

1497
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,680
Why do we do it?

1498
01:36:31,710 --> 01:36:39,780
Well, we do it to transform the tissue into a more tractable, accessible object.

1499
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,820
And the reason that works is weak.

1500
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:46,350
Having built this gel, this new infrastructure inside the tissue,

1501
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,720
we can then use chemical tricks.

1502
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:55,950
And we can link the molecules we care about, like proteins, or RNAs, which are the things as you know,

1503
01:36:55,950 --> 01:37:03,030
right before they become proteins, we can link them physically anchor them to this gel,

1504
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:07,560
which is a scaffold, basically, it's an interlocking network of polymers,

1505
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:11,520
we can link all these interesting molecules in place and lock them in,

1506
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,630
where they were initially in the tissue in the cell in all the cells.

1507
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:21,180
And then we can remove very vigorously everything we don't care about, that's blocking our

1508
01:37:21,390 --> 01:37:26,220
light that's blocking our molecules coming in to exchange information with a tissue,

1509
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:29,430
we can get rid of everything else, like the lipids, the fats,

1510
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:33,060
we can effectively use detergents to get them all out.

1511
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:37,770
And then we can see in all the things that we're absorbing are scattering light are gone,

1512
01:37:38,070 --> 01:37:40,380
you can have a brain that's completely transparent.

1513
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:43,380
And yet all the interesting molecules are still locked into place.

1514
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:45,600
They're at the cellular and sub cellular level.

1515
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:50,370
And so this is hydrogen tissue chemistry, the first form we described was called clarity,

1516
01:37:50,730 --> 01:37:53,430
we use that quite a bit still, but there are many

1517
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:57,600
variants now that we and others have developed on this basic concept of building

1518
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,160
this gel than the tissue and anchoring molecules into place, literally glass clear brains,

1519
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:06,900
I've done this, I've taken a brain cleared with this method, and looked at somebody through it,

1520
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,870
and you don't want to get it too close to your eye, don't touch it to your own eye.

1521
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,320
But, and you can see direct all the way through it.

1522
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:17,340
That's incredible.

1523
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:21,540
For the, it raises an important question, which is again, about the human brain.

1524
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:26,040
And as somebody who essentially started out in neuroanatomy, and then got into other things,

1525
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:33,360
I, I always am bothered by the fact that we actually know very little about

1526
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:38,160
the microstructure of the human brain, compared to the brains of other organisms.

1527
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,570
And in thinking about understanding the circuitry and the piano,

1528
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:47,550
so to speak that and how to manipulate it in order to relieve suffering.

1529
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:53,430
One wonders are the structures in these animal brains?

1530
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:58,710
And how they behave and active coping, passive coping, add, etc.

1531
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:03,480
Those models how well they translate to the human condition.

1532
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:07,590
Do you think it's fair to say that there are entire regions of the human brain

1533
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:12,510
that aren't just bigger, but that exists only in the brains of humans,

1534
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:14,850
especially given that we have this speech?

1535
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,900
Although I do wonder sometimes if you know, animals reporting to each other there,

1536
01:39:18,930 --> 01:39:21,510
maybe they have little psychiatric sessions with one another?

1537
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:26,790
You know, I I'm always careful to not assume we do things better,

1538
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,020
we certainly understand what we're doing better than we understand what animals are doing.

1539
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,480
And they certainly do things better than than we do.

1540
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,040
That said, we do have amazing, wonderful brains and many structures

1541
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:44,190
that are very highly developed in our brains that are not nearly so developed in mice and, and fish,

1542
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:44,790
for example.

1543
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:50,370
Now, that said, when I look at the big picture, you know, what,

1544
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:52,770
what is the mammalian brain really doing?

1545
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:59,970
There are things that you would never have thought we could study in in animals and language.

1546
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,310
Three mammals like mice, that it turns out, you can actually.

1547
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,110
And so I would never draw the line and say, here's something you can study in mice,

1548
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:14,940
or here's something that has no parallel in mice, I would be very careful before making any,

1549
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,710
any statement like that.

1550
01:40:17,160 --> 01:40:17,820
A good example of

1551
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:22,080
that is we've been able to study just in the past year come to an understanding of dissociation.

1552
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:27,930
And both, we had a paper that came out in late 2020, both mouse and human work,

1553
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:33,900
in which we got to the sort of the circuit basis for dissociation,

1554
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:38,790
what now what is dissociation that a lot of people might not have experienced it,

1555
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:43,680
but it's actually very common, more than 70% of people who've been through trauma,

1556
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:49,170
experienced dissociation, it shows up in borderline personality shows up in PTSD.

1557
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,810
What it is, is, is a separation of the sense of self from the body,

1558
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:58,530
not so you can have someone who it's not as if you're numb, you're not anesthetized,

1559
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:01,410
you can still you know, that something's happening to the body.

1560
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:05,280
But you just don't care, because you don't ascribe it to yourself.

1561
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:07,770
Which is very interesting, right?

1562
01:41:07,770 --> 01:41:10,410
That is, how interesting is that report narrative?

1563
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,450
Yeah, almost, in your book, you touch on this, and I will say is the most

1564
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:21,540
precise and meaningful and eloquent description of what might be consciousness,

1565
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:26,400
this this narrative toward the self or of the self, and where it might reside?

1566
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,480
So in dissociative conditions, people are

1567
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:35,100
feeling as kind of an absence of a merge between mind and body is that one way to describe it?

1568
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:38,880
And as I recall, this paper involved, an exploration of ketamine.

1569
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:40,380
Ketamine was a big part of it.

1570
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:40,950
Yeah, that's right.

1571
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:45,510
And so ketamine is another one of those cases where people can experience dissociation,

1572
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:50,760
ketamine, or PCP, we call these the dissociative drugs, they cause it just like these,

1573
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:53,430
these other psychiatric conditions can cause it.

1574
01:41:54,180 --> 01:41:59,100
And so we were, we were able to manifest this in in mice,

1575
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:02,100
were administering these dissociative agents in mice,

1576
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:06,510
we could make them still able to detect stimulus but not care that it was happening.

1577
01:42:07,110 --> 01:42:08,460
All the while we were

1578
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,040
recording the activity of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on what,

1579
01:42:14,370 --> 01:42:19,290
what was happening along with this dissociation, and then use optogenetics,

1580
01:42:19,290 --> 01:42:24,030
to see that it mattered to actually provide that pattern of activity and see Oh,

1581
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,220
that actually causes the dissociation.

1582
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:29,850
So we could do all that in mice, you know, which, which was,

1583
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:34,560
you know, just who would have thought that you could study something like this in mice.

1584
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:38,340
And we were able to go back and forth with human work,

1585
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,940
because here in our Stanford comprehensive epilepsy center,

1586
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:46,170
there are a lot of what we call stereo ECG recording, patients who come in,

1587
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:48,030
and in the course of normal clinical care,

1588
01:42:48,570 --> 01:42:53,430
they have electrodes recording in their brain to identify where the seizure is.

1589
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:58,710
So they can be candidates for removing a little patch of the brain that's causing the seizure,

1590
01:42:58,710 --> 01:43:02,700
this is done for patients who medications are not helping their seizure disorder.

1591
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:09,360
And there was a patient who had a dissociative state before every seizure.

1592
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,490
So there was a human being who was really dissociating,

1593
01:43:11,490 --> 01:43:13,290
who could tell us literally as it was happening.

1594
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:15,990
And we could see this pattern,

1595
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:20,160
the same pattern that was happening in the mice in the same patch of the brain,

1596
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,940
we could see that happening in the human being at exactly the right time,

1597
01:43:23,940 --> 01:43:27,540
and the same patch of the brain that's homologous across these immense

1598
01:43:27,630 --> 01:43:29,070
evolutionary distances.

1599
01:43:29,550 --> 01:43:32,880
And we knew that it mattered to both the mouse and human because in the human,

1600
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,020
we could cause it to happen.

1601
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:38,010
So I just want to underscore the power of not just that,

1602
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,160
I want to underscore the power of optogenetics,

1603
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:46,740
and the ability to not just remove a particular experience or behavior by lesioning,

1604
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,200
or destroying, but then to go back and,

1605
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:54,000
and actually activate the same structure or group of structures and see the emergence.

1606
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,220
So it's essentially, these days,

1607
01:43:56,220 --> 01:43:59,580
you hear a lot about gain of function research in the context of viral manipulation,

1608
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,980
but gain of function is something that we do in the laboratory.

1609
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:07,230
And and you do in patients, to both take away something and put it back.

1610
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:09,120
And which gives you causality.

1611
01:44:09,150 --> 01:44:09,570
That's right.

1612
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:11,940
And so and exactly and so with optogenetics,

1613
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:18,120
we were able to provide in animals without being on any any ketamine or any, any drug,

1614
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,750
and we could cause the dissociative state by playing in a precise pattern of activity.

1615
01:44:22,230 --> 01:44:26,040
And that Who would have thought you could do that, but there was a combined mouse and human paper.

1616
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:34,140
Likewise, likewise, we've been able to play in, you know, visual sensations into the brains of mice.

1617
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:41,730
And by observing which cells in the visual part of the brain visual cortex are naturally

1618
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:47,010
responsive to, for example, vertical bars, instead of horizontal bars in the visual world,

1619
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:51,150
we could see which cells were normally reporting on vertical bars,

1620
01:44:51,180 --> 01:44:54,120
and then we could use optogenetics to come and play in

1621
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:59,250
activity just to those cells to these animals are not viewing any not doing anything at all,

1622
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:02,490
and we could To activate just the vertical bar cells,

1623
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:06,420
and not only do the animal act as if it was seeing a vertical bar behaviorally,

1624
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,880
it was trained to do particularly thing if it saw a vertical bar.

1625
01:45:08,910 --> 01:45:12,090
And it did that just as if it was seeing something visually.

1626
01:45:12,630 --> 01:45:17,100
But everything in the brain that we were recording to the internal representation of this

1627
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:23,130
external world was naturalistic, too, it looked like the brain was seeing something visual.

1628
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:25,950
So that was another that's gain of function to,

1629
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:30,180
you know, playing in providing a complex sensation or percept.

1630
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,140
That wasn't there before.

1631
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:34,140
And we can do that in, you know, across species.

1632
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:39,120
So I we haven't, you know, and of course, mice are social, and they do,

1633
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:41,820
they do amazing acts of information processing.

1634
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:46,680
And so I'm I don't, I try not to disparage our cousins too much.

1635
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:50,070
We certainly have helped the field of neuroscience and medicine, I should mention,

1636
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:52,740
and I know that people are very sensitivities about animal research,

1637
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:58,650
but the work that's been carried out in mice has been absolutely vital,

1638
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,580
and instructional for treatment of human disease.

1639
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:10,470
Since we talked about dissociation, and dissociative states, rather, and ketamine,

1640
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:14,880
I'd love your thoughts on psychedelic medicine.

1641
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:19,770
You know, I sort of half joke having grown up in this area in Northern California,

1642
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:22,020
when it was much more counterculture than it is now.

1643
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,950
That many of the things that we're hearing about now,

1644
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:32,880
at least from my read of the of the history books happened before there was a movement

1645
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:36,480
aimed at taking the very same compounds, essentially,

1646
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:41,130
putting them into patients or people were obviously using them recreationally,

1647
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:44,910
but putting them into patients, and seeing tremendous positive effects,

1648
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:50,580
but also tremendous examples of induce psychiatric illness.

1649
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:54,750
In other words, many people lost their minds as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics,

1650
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,660
I'll probably lose a few people out there.

1651
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:04,320
But I do want to talk about what is the state of these compounds,

1652
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,420
and I realized it's a huge category of compounds.

1653
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,660
But LSD and psilocybin as I understand trigger activation

1654
01:47:09,810 --> 01:47:12,150
of particular serotonin receptor mechanisms,

1655
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:17,070
may or may not lead to more widespread activation of the brain more that one wouldn't

1656
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:18,030
see otherwise.

1657
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:23,310
But when you look at the clinical and experimental literature, what is your sort of top contour

1658
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,690
sense of how effective these tools are going to be for treating depression,

1659
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:31,590
and then if we have the time, we could talk about trauma and MDMA and some of that?

1660
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:38,640
Well, you're you're right to highlight both opportunity and, and the parallel that is there.

1661
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:43,260
And, of course, we want to help patients and of course, we want to,

1662
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:49,560
to explore anything that might be helpful and but we want to do it in a safe and rigorous way.

1663
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,580
But I do think we should explore these these avenues.

1664
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:59,640
These are agents that alter reality and alter the experience of reality, I should say,

1665
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:05,130
in in relatively precise ways, they they do have problems, they can be addictive,

1666
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:08,460
they can cause lasting change, that is not desirable.

1667
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:15,540
But we have to see these as opportunities, we have to first of all study in the laboratory,

1668
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:19,560
and I'm doing this here, you know, we have big,

1669
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:24,810
we have safes with many interesting psychedelics that are all very carefully regulated,

1670
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:27,210
we get inspections from the DEA, and so on.

1671
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:31,680
Anyone's hoping to find these labs, they exist in outer space you need, you need to be on board,

1672
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:35,070
one of the one of the SpaceX missions in order to access them.

1673
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:37,170
So don't try and confine now that's exactly true.

1674
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:37,500
Yes.

1675
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:43,770
And, and, and we're doing exactly this, we're saying this is an incredible opportunity,

1676
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:49,020
if we could understand how, you know, the perception of reality is altered,

1677
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,890
we could be creating new kinds of intervention that don't have

1678
01:48:53,370 --> 01:48:59,490
the risks and problems of causing lasting change or addiction.

1679
01:49:00,150 --> 01:49:07,200
Now, that said, even as these medications exist now, as you know, there's

1680
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:12,060
an impulse to use them in very small doses and to use them as adjunctive

1681
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:15,120
treatments for for the therapy of various kinds.

1682
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:19,320
And I'm also supportive of that, if done, you know, carefully and rigorously.

1683
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:23,910
Of course, there's risk, but there's risk with many other kinds of treatments.

1684
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:28,320
And I'm not sure that the risks for these medications

1685
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:32,580
vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate in other branches of medicine.

1686
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:34,020
Why would they work?

1687
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:44,730
I mean, the, you know, let's say that, indeed, their main effect is to create more, more conductivity,

1688
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:48,240
at least in the in the moment between brain areas.

1689
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:53,850
So the way I think about a very think about the two extremes of my experience anyways,

1690
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,090
a high degree of stress and focus for whatever reason,

1691
01:49:57,330 --> 01:49:59,970
is going to make create changes in my visual field and

1692
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:03,750
changes in the way that I perceive times that I'm going to micro slice time,

1693
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:08,790
I might mean a very contracted view of whatever my experiences, whereas on the opposite extreme,

1694
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:15,180
in a, in a dream, or in sleep space and time are very fluid, and essentially relaxed.

1695
01:50:15,180 --> 01:50:16,980
Although it might be a very interesting dream,

1696
01:50:16,980 --> 01:50:24,660
it might not be a psychedelic seem to be a trajectory, not off too far off from the dream state,

1697
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:29,130
where space and time are essentially not as rigid.

1698
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:35,790
And there is this element of synesthesia, a blending of the senses, you know, feeling colors,

1699
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:40,110
and hearing light and things of that sort.

1700
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:42,270
If you hear these reports anyway.

1701
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:49,650
Why would having that dreamlike experience somehow relieve depression?

1702
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:50,760
Long term?

1703
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,880
Do we have any idea why that might be?

1704
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:57,090
We have some ideas?

1705
01:50:57,120 --> 01:50:59,190
Uh, no, no deep understanding.

1706
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:02,820
One way I think about the psychedelics is they

1707
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:10,680
increase our willingness to increase the willingness of our brain to accept unlikely

1708
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:15,060
ways of constructing the world unlikely hypotheses as it were,

1709
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:18,270
as to what's going on the brain in particular cortex,

1710
01:51:18,270 --> 01:51:21,840
I think is a hypothesis generation and testing machine,

1711
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:26,730
it's coming up with models about everything, it's got all the bits of data coming in.

1712
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:30,240
And it's making models and updating the models and changing them

1713
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:32,490
theories hypotheses for what's going on.

1714
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:36,030
And some of those never reach our conscious mind.

1715
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:40,350
And this is something I talked about in projections, and in the book, quite a bit is,

1716
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:44,520
many of these are filtered out before they get to our conscious mind.

1717
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:45,150
And that's good.

1718
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:49,860
We think how distracted we'd be if we were constantly having to evaluate all these,

1719
01:51:49,890 --> 01:51:54,030
you know, hypotheses about what kinds of shapes or objects or processes were out there.

1720
01:51:54,810 --> 01:51:59,010
And so a lot of this is handled, before it gets to consciousness,

1721
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:03,450
what the psychedelics seem to do is they change the

1722
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:09,930
threshold for us to become aware of these incomplete hypotheses or wrong hypotheses or,

1723
01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:14,160
or concepts that might be noise, but are just wrong,

1724
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:16,950
and so are never allowed to get into our conscious mind.

1725
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:20,940
Now, you know that that's pretty interesting.

1726
01:52:20,940 --> 01:52:26,400
And it goes wrong and psychiatric disorders, I think, in schizophrenia, at some times,

1727
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:31,620
the paranoid delusions that people have are examples of these

1728
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:37,410
poor models that escape into the conscious mind and become accepted as reality,

1729
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:39,180
and they never should have gotten out there.

1730
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:44,610
Now, how could something like this in the right way, help with something like depression,

1731
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:51,540
patients with depression often are, are stuck, they can't

1732
01:52:53,790 --> 01:53:04,020
look into the future world of possibilities as effectively there's everything seems hopeless,

1733
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,160
and what does that really mean?

1734
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:08,280
They, they discount the value of their own action,

1735
01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:12,900
they discount the value of the world at giving rise to a future that matters.

1736
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:17,490
Everything seems to run out like a river just running out into a desert and drying up.

1737
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:25,500
And what these agents may do that increase the flow through circuitry, if you will,

1738
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:27,960
the percolation of activity through circuitry may

1739
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:33,600
end up doing for depression is increasing the the escape of some some tendrils of,

1740
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:37,770
of process of forward progression through through the world.

1741
01:53:38,850 --> 01:53:41,100
That's a concept, it's how I think about it.

1742
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:47,100
There are ways we can make that rigorous we can indeed identify in the brain by recording,

1743
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:53,280
we can see cells that represent steps along a path and look into the future.

1744
01:53:54,150 --> 01:53:56,520
And we can rigorously define these cells,

1745
01:53:56,550 --> 01:54:01,110
and we can see if these are altered on psychedelics and so that's one of the reasons that we're

1746
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:04,440
working with these agents in the laboratory to say

1747
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,080
are Is this really the case are these opening up

1748
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:11,790
new paths or or representations of paths into the future?

1749
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:20,250
MDMA, ecstasy is a unique compound in that it leads to big increases in

1750
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:24,690
brain levels of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously.

1751
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:27,420
And I realized that the neuromodulators like dopamine,

1752
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:31,980
serotonin often work in concert not alone the way they're commonly described in the,

1753
01:54:32,910 --> 01:54:38,910
you know, the more general popular discussions, however, it is a unique compound,

1754
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:42,540
and it's different than the serotonergic compounds like LSD and psilocybin.

1755
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:51,090
And there are now data still emerging that it might be and in some cases,

1756
01:54:51,570 --> 01:54:55,800
can be useful for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things.

1757
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,150
Why?

1758
01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:58,980
Why would that work?

1759
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:06,540
And do you think A larger question, perhaps the more important question is psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,

1760
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:08,190
all those compounds there?

1761
01:55:08,490 --> 01:55:10,050
In my mind, there are two components.

1762
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,720
There's the experience you have while you're on them.

1763
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:15,120
And then there's the effect they have after

1764
01:55:16,290 --> 01:55:21,990
people are generating variations of these compounds that are non hallucinatory variations.

1765
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:25,350
But how crucial Do you think it is to have?

1766
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:31,500
Let's stay with MDMA, the experience of huge levels of dopamine,

1767
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:34,890
huge levels of serotonin atypical levels of dopamine,

1768
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:39,510
serotonin released having this highly abnormal experience in order to be normal again,

1769
01:55:40,830 --> 01:55:44,490
I think the brain learns from those experiences, that's that's the way I see it.

1770
01:55:44,490 --> 01:55:49,650
And so for example, people on who've taken MDMA, they will, as you say,

1771
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,380
they'll have they'll be the acute phase of being

1772
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:59,280
on the drug and experiencing the this extreme connectedness with other people, for example.

1773
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,850
And then the drug wears off.

1774
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:06,150
And but the brain learn from that experience.

1775
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:10,950
And so what what people will report is, yeah, I'm not I'm not in that state.

1776
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:17,400
But I saw what was possible, you know, I saw Yeah, you can, there need to be barriers,

1777
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:19,740
or at least not as many barriers As I thought,

1778
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:24,000
I can connect with more people in a way that that is helpful.

1779
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:29,400
And so I think it's the learning that happens in that state that actually matters.

1780
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,520
And this as you describe that, that sounds a lot like what I understand

1781
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,600
to be the hallmark feature of really good psychoanalysis that the relationship between

1782
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:40,650
patient and therapist hopefully evolves to the point where

1783
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:45,840
these kinds of tests can be run within the context of that relationship,

1784
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,910
and then export it to other relations.

1785
01:56:47,910 --> 01:56:48,810
That exactly right.

1786
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:53,670
And that probably assuming is still the goal of really good psychiatry, also,

1787
01:56:53,849 --> 01:57:01,709
it's a part of intimacy, really, it should be, when we have time, I think I'll good psychiatrist,

1788
01:57:01,709 --> 01:57:08,699
try to achieve that, that level of connection and learning, try to help patients create a new,

1789
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:15,359
a new model that is stable, that is learned, and that can help instruct future behavior.

1790
01:57:16,139 --> 01:57:22,139
One of the things that I took from reading your book, in addition to learning so much science,

1791
01:57:22,169 --> 01:57:29,009
and the future of psychiatry and brain science was, you know, amidst these many, many kids,

1792
01:57:29,009 --> 01:57:33,119
very tragic cases and sadness, and a lot of the, the,

1793
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:37,559
the weight that that puts on the clinician on you also, that there's a,

1794
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:45,869
that there's a central chord of, of optimism, that where we're headed is not just possible,

1795
01:57:45,869 --> 01:57:48,119
but very likely and better.

1796
01:57:48,869 --> 01:57:52,769
And, you know, are you an optimist?

1797
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:53,730
I am.

1798
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,870
And this this is, by the way, this was a really interesting experience in writing projections,

1799
01:57:57,870 --> 01:58:02,670
because I had a dual goal, I wanted it to be for everybody,

1800
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:07,590
literally everybody in the world who wants to read it.

1801
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:14,940
And yet, at the same time, I wanted to stay absolutely, rigorously,

1802
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:17,730
close to the the science what was actually known.

1803
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:20,730
When I was speaking about science,

1804
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:25,950
when I was speaking about the neurobiology of the brain or psychiatry, I wanted to,

1805
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:33,060
to not have any of my scientific colleagues think oh, he's, he's going too far using too much.

1806
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:37,080
And so I had these these two goals, which I kept an eye on my mind the entire time.

1807
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:40,620
And a lot of this trying to find exactly the right word we talked about was

1808
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:45,630
on this path of staying excruciating Lee rigorous in the science and yet,

1809
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:52,140
letting people see the hope the where things were everybody see that we've come a long way,

1810
01:58:52,140 --> 01:58:53,340
we have a long way to go.

1811
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:58,350
But, but the trajectory and the path is beautiful.

1812
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:05,070
And so that, that that was the goal, I think, you know, of course,

1813
01:59:05,070 --> 01:59:10,620
that sounds almost impossible to jointly satisfy those two, those two goals,

1814
01:59:10,620 --> 01:59:12,930
but I kept that in my mind the whole way through.

1815
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:14,340
And yes, I am optimistic.

1816
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:17,340
And I hope that came through in the book, but it certainly did.

1817
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:22,500
And at least from this colleague, you, you did achieve both.

1818
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:28,380
And it's a wonderful, it's a masterful book, really, and one that as a scientist,

1819
01:59:28,380 --> 01:59:31,980
and somebody who is a Brit, fellow brain Explorer,

1820
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:36,480
hits all the marks of rigor and is incredibly interesting.

1821
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,860
And there's a ton of storytelling.

1822
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,300
I don't want to give away too much about it.

1823
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:41,520
But people should definitely check out the book.

1824
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:44,220
Are you active on social media,

1825
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:47,670
if people want to follow you and connect with what you're doing now?

1826
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:48,570
And going forward?

1827
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,010
Yeah, I have a Twitter.

1828
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,290
That's where I mainly do.

1829
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:56,190
Exchange, you know, tell people about things that are happening.

1830
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:59,250
We'll provide a link to it, but that's Karl deisseroth has ever called with a K.

1831
01:59:59,280 --> 01:59:59,670
That's right.

1832
01:59:59,700 --> 01:59:59,940
Yeah.

1833
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:06,480
And so you're on Twitter, and people will hear this, definitely check out the book.

1834
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:09,330
There are other people in our community that

1835
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:13,230
of course are going to be reaching out on your behalf.

1836
02:00:13,230 --> 02:00:17,670
But it's it's incredible that you juggle this enormous number of things.

1837
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:21,480
Perhaps even more important,

1838
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:25,860
however, is that it's all in service to this larger thing of relieving suffering.

1839
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:29,130
So thank you so much for your time today for the book,

1840
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,560
and the work that went into the book I can't even imagine

1841
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:34,080
for the laboratory work and the development channel opsins,

1842
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,530
clarity and all the related technologies and for the clinical work you're doing and,

1843
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:38,970
and for sharing with us.

1844
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:41,310
