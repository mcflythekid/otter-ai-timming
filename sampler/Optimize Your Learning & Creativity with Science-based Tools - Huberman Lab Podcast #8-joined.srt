00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Welcome to the human lab Podcast

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,790
where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,830
My name is Andrew Huberman

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,360
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,110
This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,220
It is however

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,180
part of my desire and effort to bring you zero cost of consumer information about science

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,620
and science related tools.

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,940
In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,550
Our first sponsor is insidetracker.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,270
Insidetracker analyzes data from your blood and DNA

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,870
to help you better understand your body and health and health needs.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,330
I've been getting my blood tested for many years now, because it just turns out that

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,910
many of the things that are important to our health and well being

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,270
can only be detected in a blood test or a DNA test.

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,850
Insidetracker makes that really easy.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,250
They can come to your house to take those samples if you like.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,220
Or you can go to a nearby clinic as well.

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,960
The major problem

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,640
with most blood tests and DNA tests is that it's very hard to make sense of the information you get

21
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,690
you know a lot of numbers related to metabolic factors, endocrine factors, etc.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,560
Insidetracker makes it very easy to decipher what those levels in your blood and DNA mean

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,480
and what to do about them.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,420
They have a very easy to use dashboard that if you go to it

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,210
it can inform about lifestyle choices such as

26
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,780
adding or subtracting certain forms of exercise or nutrition

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,580
other things related to supplementation, it's a really powerful and easy to use program.

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,430
If you want to try insidetracker you can go to insidetracker comm slash Huberman

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,450
and put Huberman at checkout to get 25% off any of their programs.

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,860
That's inside tracker comm slash Huberman and put Huberman at checkout.

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,450
The second sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

32
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,800
Athletic Greens is an all in one vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

33
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,070
I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,470
And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,280
I started using Athletic Greens and I still use Athletic Greens.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,460
Because I find it very complicated

37
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,330
and almost dizzying to figure out which vitamins and minerals I need to take in order to just

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,980
cover my nutritional basis.

39
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,860
Taking Athletic Greens makes that very easy.

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,150
It also tastes very good.

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,900
I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon juice, and I really like it

42
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,430
so I drink it once or twice a day.

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,090
The probiotics that are in Athletic Greens are also important to me

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,020
because there are a lot of data now showing that the gut microbiome

45
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:36,300
which is supported by probiotics is important for things like the gut, brain access mood

46
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,470
endocrine factors, metabolism, many, many biological functions.

47
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,960
And so by taking Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,820
the minerals and the probiotics all in one easy to consume great tasting drink.

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,950
If you want to try Athletic Greens

50
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,030
you can go to Athletic Greens comm slash Huberman and if you do that

51
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,680
you'll also get one year supply of liquid vitamin d3 k two.

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,140
There are a lot of data now as well showing that vitamin d3 is important for immune function

53
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,090
for mood endocrine factors, as well as other systems in the brain and body.

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,650
That's Athletic Greens calm slash Huberman and I should also mention if you do that

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,320
you won't just get the vitamin d3 K to your supply.

56
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,220
You also get five free travel packs of Athletic Greens.

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,740
Mixing up powders when one is on the road, either in the car or in a hotel or on the plane etc.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,610
Can be kind of messy.

59
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,860
These little travel packs make it really clean and easy.

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,480
So once again, if you go to Athletic Greens comm slash Huberman you'll get a special offer

61
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,580
of your Athletic Greens but you'll also get

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,750
the a year supply of vitamin d3 k two and the five free travel packs.

63
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,900
The third sponsor of today's podcast is made for

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,900
made four is a behavioral science company that makes

65
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,470
attaining positive changes and growth mindset easy

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,680
through a simple set of steps and a monthly program.

67
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,170
The company was founded by former Navy SEAL Patrick Dossett and Tom's founder Blake Mycoskie

68
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,690
I'm the head of their scientific advisory board.

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,400
And the other members of the advisory board

70
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,310
include people like the director of the chronobiology unit

71
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,790
the National Institutes of mental health, members of Harvard Medical School

72
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,080
and many other people who are serious about taking science and developing protocols

73
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,070
that can be applied towards positive habits and growth mindset.

74
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,360
If you want to check out made for you can go to get made for.com.

75
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,200
And if you purchase any of their products and put Huberman at checkout

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,000
you'll get 20% off their program.

77
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,020
In addition to that

78
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,690
we do a monthly zoom call where the members are made for get on it and Patrick and myself

79
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,760
sometimes Blake as well discuss the main four program and the personal goals and

80
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,280
things that people are trying to achieve with the program.

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,070
So it's a dialogue back and forth on zoom call once a month.

82
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,640
Once again, that's get made for comm put in Huberman at checkout

83
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,050
and you'll be able to get the 20% off as well as access the monthly zoom calls with us.

84
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Let's talk about neural plasticity.

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,130
More specifically, let's talk about how we can optimize our brain neural plasticity

86
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,570
is this incredible feature of our nervous system that allows it to change itself

87
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,570
even in ways that we consciously decide.

88
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,820
That's an incredible property, our liver can't decide to just change itself

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,870
our spleen can't decide to just change itself through conscious thought

90
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,480
or through feedback from another person.

91
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,990
The cells in those tissues can make changes, sure

92
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:31,710
but it's our nervous system that harbors this incredible ability to direct its own changes

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,110
in ways that we believe, or we're told will serve us better.

94
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,840
Now, today's a really special episode, because while we are going to talk about science

95
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,480
and as always, we will delve into mechanism.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,700
Today's episode is really geared toward answering your most common questions

97
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,010
about how to leverage neural plasticity.

98
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,470
The previous episodes were about focus, and how to achieve focus for sake of plasticity

99
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,630
as well as the last episode, which is

100
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,200
what are some of the portals into plasticity that relate to movement?

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,390
How behavior can activate plasticity

102
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,080
as well as how to activate plasticity for behavior itself?

103
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,270
How to get better at learning certain movements?

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,610
Today's podcast is really directed toward answering your most common questions.

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,170
And the bigger theme

106
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,510
of how does one go about optimizing their brain or even think about optimizing the brain?

107
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,240
What is this thing that we're calling optimizing the brain?

108
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,230
In doing?

109
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,250
So I'm also going to share some of my typical routines and tools.

110
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,880
I don't share these because I think that they are the only ones that are available out there.

111
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,800
Certainly they're not, nor do I share them

112
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,020
because I think that everyone should do them just because I do them.

113
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,430
Certainly not.

114
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,860
I share them because many of you

115
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,040
have asked for very concrete examples of what I do and when and so I'll share those with you.

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,510
And you can decide whether or not those protocols are for you or not, everybody's different.

117
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,580
But there are some common features

118
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,810
of how we are all put together at the level of the nervous system and body

119
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,230
that direct us toward particular practices

120
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,250
particular routines that can be especially powerful for neural plasticity.

121
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,820
So I want to open up the discussion today

122
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,480
by emphasizing something that's fundamentally important

123
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,840
which is that plasticity is not the goal.

124
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:21,060
Plasticity is never the goal.

125
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,270
Plasticity is simply a state, or a capacity for our nervous system to change.

126
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,600
And so nothing makes me more frustrated, perhaps then when I hear Oh, you know, this pill

127
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,200
this potion this practice, it gives you plasticity, plasticity is just change.

128
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,690
The real question is, what are you trying to change?

129
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,080
And specifically, what end goal Are you trying to achieve?

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,460
Specific end goals might be extremely specific

131
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,860
like, you want to learn how to speak a particular language, or you want to learn a new motor skill

132
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,870
or you want to get very good at calculus

133
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:04,050
or you'd like to forget the bad emotions related to a particular human being, or experience

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,800
or can be more general, like you'd like to be more creative.

135
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,920
We'll actually talk about creative creativity today

136
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,970
or you would like to achieve more focus or you'd like to be less stressed.

137
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,230
So it's very important that you understand that plasticity.

138
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,100
And achieving plasticity is the first step in what we call optimizing your brain.

139
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,590
You don't want your brain to be plastic all the time.

140
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,080
In fact, one of the major questions one

141
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,850
of the major Unsolved Mysteries of neuroscience is how each and every one of us wakes up every day

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,710
and knows who we are.

143
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,540
Why should that be?

144
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,070
Well, the brain is plastic, it has a capacity to change throughout the lifespan

145
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,340
but it's not so plastic, that every night when we go to sleep

146
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,140
or in our waking that the connections get reconfigured, so much so that we forget who we are

147
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,730
how to walk, or how to eat.

148
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,850
It's a good thing that we don't have such robust plasticity or ongoing plasticity

149
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:04,200
that we have to restructure ourselves each day, it's part of what gives our life continuity.

150
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,860
So remember, plasticity is not an is never the goal.

151
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,700
The goal is to figure out how to access plasticity, and then to direct that plasticity

152
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,020
toward particular goals or changes that you would like to achieve.

153
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,430
And I should just mention, there's no rule that in life

154
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,520
you have to leverage this incredible thing called neuroplasticity

155
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,840
no one said you had to do that.

156
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,830
This podcast and this episode is particularly for people who

157
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,900
are either happy or unhappy with where they're at with a particular aspect of their life.

158
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,570
And they want to shift it in some positive way.

159
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,360
And many of you listening might say, well, wouldn't everyone want to do that?

160
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,450
Well, actually, there are a certain number of people that are pretty good where they're at

161
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,160
and they don't want to change and that's terrific.

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
And I tip my hat to them.

163
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,400
And I think that's wonderful.

164
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,270
If ever they decide that they want to leverage these plasticity mechanisms

165
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,000
they can at any stage throughout the lifespan.

166
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,360
Let's start by talking about the different systems within the nervous system

167
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,610
that are available for plasticity.

168
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,760
And in doing so I'll frame them in the context of what I do on a daily basis, on a weekly basis

169
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,200
and on a yearly basis.

170
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,000
First of all, there are several forms of plasticity.

171
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,440
They have names like long term potentiation, long term depression

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,720
which has nothing to do with emotional depression, by the way

173
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,420
and things like spike timing dependent plasticity

174
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,840
those names are used to describe cellular phenomenon, the actual ways that the synapses

175
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,050
the connections between neurons change, I'll mention those things.

176
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,560
And I'll give a little more meat as to what they are, as I mentioned them.

177
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:45,990
But that's probably not the best way to think about plasticity in terms of optimizing your brain

178
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,650
the best way to think about it is in terms of short term, medium term, and long term plasticity.

179
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,480
Short term plasticity is any kind of shift that you want to achieve in the moment or in the day

180
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,630
but that you don't necessarily want to hold on to forever, might say

181
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,100
Well, what kinds of things are those?

182
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,540
Well, for instance

183
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,400
short term plasticity might be you wake up earlier than you would like to catch a flight

184
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,010
you're not feeling particularly alert.

185
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,650
And you want to use a protocol, or you decide to use a protocol, which could be coffee

186
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,500
or it could be a certain form of breathing, or it could be some other tool

187
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,740
to become more alert at a time of day when normally you aren't that alert.

188
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,310
But your expectation is that when you return home

189
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,010
you will discard with that the need to do that at 5:30am, because you'll be asleep at 5:30am.

190
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,470
So they're short term plasticity, behavioral plasticity.

191
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,200
Then there's medium term plasticity

192
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,710
which are changes that you might want to make I call this with respect, and a little bit of humor

193
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,170
or at least my kind of humor, I call this the, the undergraduate

194
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,080
pre med phenomenon for those of you that have worked with

195
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,890
pre meds and have tremendous respect for medical students and pre meds

196
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,590
there is a a kind of a stereotype which I don't necessarily agree with.

197
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,070
But the stereotype is that they want to know what they need to know for sake of the exam

198
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,020
but they don't really want to know they just want the A.

199
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,730
And I don't think that's always true.

200
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,460
I've worked with a number of different pre meds over the years.

201
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,490
And there are many of them that are absolutely passionate about the knowledge itself.

202
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,850
And they also wanted the A, but the pre med phenomenon

203
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,290
as it's discussed among professors and ta is is that, that, you know, you've got these students

204
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,700
they just want to know what they need to know.

205
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,490
So they can get the a right, it's medium term plasticity

206
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,100
they don't actually want it to be embedded in their memory too long

207
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,260
or else they would actually care about the information.

208
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,360
So that's medium term information.

209
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,680
And sometimes that's useful.

210
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,630
For instance, if you go on vacation to Costa Rica, and you don't know your way around Costa Rica

211
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,970
you want to learn the different town and the routes there

212
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,940
you don't have any intention of going back, it's just medium term

213
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,190
you want to just program it in for sake of your time there.

214
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,330
And then you want to discard it.

215
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,750
Most of the time, when we think about or talk about optimizing the brain

216
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,790
we're talking about long term plasticity

217
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,690
we're talking about the kinds of changes that people want to make so that their brain

218
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,910
reflexively works differently.

219
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,740
This is what a child does, when it goes from not knowing how to walk to knowing how to walk

220
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,280
it doesn't have to think about it after it learns how to walk, it becomes reflexive.

221
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,320
Long term plasticity, is almost always the big goal.

222
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,070
It's I want to know how to speak that language, I want to be able to do that skill

223
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,460
I want to be able to feel this way without having to put much work into it.

224
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,610
And there are tools and protocols that one can do to achieve that.

225
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,110
And we are going to talk about those.

226
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,710
We've talked about a few of them in previous episodes, but I will revisit those protocols.

227
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,310
Today.

228
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:43,920
I'm gonna frame all this in the context of the daily life, the weekly life and the yearly life.

229
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,050
And that's because neural plasticity and optimizing your brain

230
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,430
rides on a deeper foundation of this thing that governs plasticity

231
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,090
and, in fact governs all our life called autonomic arousal

232
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:04,350
which is that we're asleep for part of the 24 hour cycle and we are awake, almost always

233
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,450
if we push ourselves and stay awake, we're okay.

234
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,160
We can do that for a night or two.

235
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,440
But almost always, we are asleep for a portion of it.

236
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,790
And we are awake for a portion of it.

237
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,820
I've said it before, but I'll say it again

238
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,740
the trigger for plasticity and learning occurs during high focus, high alertness states

239
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,090
not while you're asleep.

240
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,580
And the focus and alertness are both key

241
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,520
because of the neuro chemicals associated with those states.

242
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,430
But the actual rewiring and the

243
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,600
reconfiguration of the brain connections happens during non sleep deep rest

244
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,260
which we'll talk more about as always, and deep sleep.

245
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,410
So you trigger the change and then sleep you get the change.

246
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,600
So some of the

247
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,910
things that we'll talk about today about optimizing the brain are centered around not sleep

248
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,400
but around the autonomic arousal system.

249
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,540
We have this system of neurons in our brain and body that's just incredible.

250
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,330
That wake us up and make us alert and when we're not accessing system

251
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,020
well, we cannot access plasticity, we cannot optimize our brain.

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,210
Likewise, if we cannot sleep well, and we can't rest, well, we will not

253
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,570
access plasticity and rewire our brain because that's when the

254
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,090
actual configuration between the connections occurs.

255
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,500
So to set this in context, I wake up each day.

256
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:26,130
And I'll be totally honest, I usually don't feel like bouncing right out of bed

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,230
I usually don't feel completely rested.

258
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,720
And that's not because I don't get enough sleep.

259
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,920
It's probably because I'm not terrific about timing my sleep so well.

260
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,860
Now, this month isn't about sleep that was the previous month.

261
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,840
But I really want to emphasize a few points.

262
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,120
I wake up, generally more tired, and groggy than I would like, because I tend to go to sleep too late.

263
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,980
That's just some thing that I do.

264
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,970
And I tend to get up early either because I set an alarm because I have things to do

265
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,900
or because I naturally wake up early, because the light coming in and so forth.

266
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,950
Well, what that tells me is that I'm probably somebody whose natural circadian rhythm

267
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,360
you may have heard of chronotypes.

268
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,010
These are genetically programmed things.

269
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,620
But chronotype is shorter than 24 hours

270
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,970
it means that the cycle of waking and alertness for me is probably shorter than 24 hours

271
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,680
which means that getting some light in the late afternoon will help me shift

272
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,870
and make my cycle a little bit longer

273
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,020
it will phase delay me if that doesn't make any sense to your previous episode.

274
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,210
But what it really means is getting some light in the afternoon

275
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,070
will allow me to stay up a little bit later.

276
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:35,970
But what it means is that I'm not really matching my hardwired

277
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,670
needs of going to bed probably at 830 or nine and waking up at 4am

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,810
I tend to go to sleep around 10 3011 lately around 1130 or 12.

279
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,950
And then I wake up at six.

280
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,360
And so of course I'm gonna feel groggy.

281
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,920
So neural plasticity will allow me to optimize my wakefulness

282
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,680
but I have to do something in order to access that, that.

283
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,820
And some of you may already be anticipating what I'm about to say, which is Oh, no

284
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,120
he's going to tell us to get sunlight in her eyes in the first 30 minutes of the day.

285
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,620
I am going to tell you to do that.

286
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,400
But I'm going to also tell you two things that I have not discussed before

287
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,080
which relate to the plasticity between the melanopsin cells

288
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,760
these sunlight detecting bright light detecting cells in our eye and the circadian clock.

289
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,920
I've never said this before on this podcast.

290
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,270
But it turns out that the connections between these melanopsin cells in the circadian clock

291
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,210
are plastic throughout the lifespan.

292
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,310
There's a massive configuration

293
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,330
of the connections there and a cell type called the astrocytes which are a glial cell

294
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,960
are actively removing and reinforcing connections between the eye and that clock every day.

295
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,070
Now, this is incredible, because other aspects of your brain that, for instance

296
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,260
represent you knowing who you are when you wake up in the morning, or what your name is

297
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,540
assuming that you're old enough that you've already learned your name.

298
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,410
One of the first things kids learn and something we rarely ever forget.

299
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,470
Those connections are changing all the time every 24 hour cycle.

300
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,110
So there's an opportunity for short term plasticity.

301
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,960
So that's why I've used sunlight first thing in the day, it helps me wake up.

302
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,110
The other thing that I do is that there's a circuit

303
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,730
that exists between the circadian clock and our adrenal that I've talked about before

304
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,630
that triggers the release of cortisol first thing in the morning, that wakes us up

305
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,070
especially when we view light.

306
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,160
So if you're groggy in the morning, that's why viewing light is helpful.

307
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,410
But the interesting thing is if you start viewing light frequently in the morning

308
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,280
then those connections between the melanopsin cells and the circadian clock become primed

309
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,630
or potentially ated, we would say they become stronger for the anticipation of light

310
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,080
and you naturally start waking up earlier feeling more alert.

311
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,750
So what this says is, and what I do is I get that regular light, because I know that some mornings

312
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm just not going to feel very alert, I'll feel especially tired.

313
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,590
And I might not

314
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,340
be able to access sunlight because it's really overcast or I'm traveling or some other feature

315
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,370
but the system is plastic so it shifted in the right direction.

316
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,900
Now it will shift back because it's short term plasticity after about two three days

317
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,630
so you want to try and get the sunlight exposure on a regular basis.

318
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,870
The other thing that I do is I delay my intake of caffeine for the first two hours that I'm awake.

319
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,270
Now this can be very painful for people.

320
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,910
But earlier we talked about

321
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,870
the adenosine system and how the accumulation of adenosine makes us sleepy.

322
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,970
And caffeine suppresses adenosine, it makes us feel alert.

323
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,190
But we know that if you ingest caffeine immediately on Waking

324
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,700
the signal to the adrenals to release cortisol

325
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,410
which is a healthy release of cortisol and the suppression of adenosine that that

326
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,050
that happens as we come out of sleep.

327
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,180
When dnn deep sleep the suppression of adenosine, if you ingest caffeine too early

328
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,890
there's a mechanism by which the adenosine competes for the receptors etc.

329
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,500
So that you have a mid morning crash.

330
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:01,080
Because if the if caffeine The way it works is if caffeine is occupying the adenosine receptor

331
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,420
then the natural endogenous mechanisms for suppressing adenosine

332
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,820
are not actually going to have their action.

333
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,350
So the brain to adrenal axis is subject to plasticity also.

334
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,220
And so by delaying caffeine until about two hours after waking

335
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm able to capture and reinforce to potentially eight

336
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,120
the neural circuit that exists between the circadian clock

337
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,950
and the cortisol release in the adrenals.

338
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,660
As well as leave those adenosine receptors unoccupied

339
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,750
so that I can then use the caffeine to get a natural lift in alertness and focus Two hours later

340
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,070
as opposed to using it just to wake myself up out of sleepiness.

341
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,840
So while I'm sure there are some idols out there, and some yawns, but oh, no

342
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,340
it's the sunlight in the morning thing.

343
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,790
Again, it's a powerful tool for readjusting these circuits.

344
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,260
So there's short term plasticity.

345
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,470
And the reason for delaying caffeine for the first two hours of the day

346
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:01,140
even if it's painful to do for the first couple days is that then you naturally start to wake up

347
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,870
more readily in the morning without caffeine because the adenosine is suppressed

348
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,670
and you don't have these competing.

349
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:14,640
It's an it's called a competing antagonist for the adenosine receptor.

350
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,080
So I wake up, I get sunlight in my eyes lately, because I wake up very early

351
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,320
I do use a bright light to stimulate a alertness, it's not actually designed for that purpose.

352
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,240
It's just a light bar that has an about 900.

353
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,550
Lux, and then I delay caffeine.

354
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,590
Some of you have asked, and again, I'm not saying that anyone has to do this

355
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,000
you know, what exactly do you drink.

356
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,740
I'm a big believer in black coffee, I just happen to like black coffee people have asked me about

357
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,950
and I don't want to name brand names here about this type of coffee

358
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,460
or that type of coffee mixed with these other kinds of things.

359
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,470
Will that increase focus?

360
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,750
You know, we're gonna I'm going to talk today a lot about the use of of diet and fasting and timing

361
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,280
of foods and certain kinds of foods.

362
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,580
But to be honest, black coffee is just a simple choice.

363
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,180
That's always worked for me. I also make sure I hydrate first thing in the morning

364
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,520
there is plenty of data now showing that even a slight increase in dehydration

365
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,300
meaning just when you're lacking water can make people have headaches

366
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,730
it can provide some additional photophobia.

367
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,420
For those of you that are migraine prone, bright light can trigger migraines

368
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,820
that's no surprise to those of you that get headaches and migraines.

369
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,340
But dehydration can can compound the vulnerability to migraine and headaches.

370
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,980
So I drink water, I drink black coffee, or I drink Mati

371
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,410
which is just because I have Argentine lineage

372
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,440
which is just a high caffeine drink first thing in the morning

373
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,200
but I delay it until two hours after I wake up.

374
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,050
And that's because I want

375
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,550
the circuits between my eye and my and my circadian clock and my adrenals

376
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,650
to be functioning in a particular way.

377
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,640
So that then later the caffeine is an addition, it adds more alertness.

378
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,880
Now this is a discussion about how to optimize your brain.

379
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,800
Many people who wake up quickly and just naturally feel like bouncing out of bed

380
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:06,120
I envy these people, they will do just fine by going into a learning bout or taking care of

381
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,160
whatever it is that they need to take care of.

382
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,720
Sometimes that's kind of more mundane tasks like email, or, and whatnot.

383
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:20,730
Here's a more or less a rule about how the brain functions visa V, focus, learning and creativity.

384
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,940
And I'm going to discuss this much more in future episodes.

385
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,710
Generally states of high alertness, when we're very, very alert

386
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,350
are great for strategy implementation when we already know how to do something.

387
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:41,580
And it's just simply a matter of plugging the correct elements into the correct boxes, things.

388
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,550
I've talked before about duration, path and outcome

389
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,380
as the three things that the deliberate conscious brain is trying to figure out in order

390
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,200
to perform certain tasks, even cognitive tasks.

391
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,420
This is the sort of thing that we are very good at when we're well rested.

392
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,910
And we're focused and our autonomic arousal or our alertness rather, as it is at a high level.

393
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,160
If you are somebody who is hitting that alertness phase of your day very early

394
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,370
right after you wake up, that's a great time to move right into things that least the research says

395
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,420
You already know, have the strategy, you just want to implement the strategy.

396
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,050
This is where I fundamentally depart from the idea that oh

397
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,930
you know, you have to do the hardest or most critical tasks throughout the day.

398
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:29,160
Sometimes the hardest and most critical tasks are tasks that require creativity.

399
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,840
And as we'll soon talk about creativity, and tasks related to it, oftentimes, come

400
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,670
come to us best or the brain is best at achieving those when we're in states of

401
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,770
calm or even slightly drowsy, which is something that's interesting and what we'll get into.

402
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,680
But for me, for instance, I get up I'm not terribly alert first thing and so I try and just get

403
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,660
my brain and my thoughts organized.

404
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,730
It's not a time for me to be responding in a very linear fashion to emails or carrying out

405
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,330
calculations that comes about two hours later, I think, um

406
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,000
many people out there will relate mid morning is when we

407
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,200
tend to when many people tend to achieve their peak in alertness and focus.

408
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,030
Now, many times I get the question and this is this

409
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,990
what I'm about to say is directly related to the hundreds of questions I got about this.

410
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,040
Should I use background music in order to learn?

411
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,340
Should I have, you know, construction next door?

412
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,840
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

413
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,210
Is it better to be in complete silence, etc.

414
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,200
Now, this will vary.

415
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,010
Some people can tolerate their own noise within their head much better than others.

416
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,970
Other people find that having some background noise helps cancel that out.

417
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,820
But there's a simple rule of thumb that one can use because at least my experience

418
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,890
is that sometimes background music background noise is very helpful for allowing me to focus.

419
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,560
And other times, it's very distracting.

420
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,210
So what actually governs that?

421
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:01,050
Well, we have to ask ourselves, what is at the source of the lack of focus?

422
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:06,570
If our lack of focus is because our autonomic arousal or our alertness is very, very high

423
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:10,380
we had a little too much coffee, or we, if there is such a thing slept a little too long

424
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,460
or we're really stressed or really activated, and we can't seem to focus.

425
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,020
In that case, eliminating background noise, and really just trying to get silence so that we can

426
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,700
quiet some of that autonomic arousal is going to be best for

427
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,260
learning and for implementation of things we already know how to do

428
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,410
for any kind of focus linear task, which

429
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,970
basically learning is a focus linear tasks is that you're just not necessarily performing well

430
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,480
all the time.

431
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,950
Last time, we talked about making errors.

432
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:47,460
So as a rule of thumb, if you're feeling too keyed up, then silence and quiet is going to be helpful.

433
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,460
In fact, if you're very keyed up, a particular circuit related to the basal ganglia

434
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,660
starts getting triggered more easily in this circuit I'm going to talk about in depth

435
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,610
but it's called the go nogo circuit, we have circuits that connect our forebrain

436
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,250
towards structure in our brain called the basal ganglia

437
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,870
which is actually a collection of structures.

438
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,510
And the forebrain, which is involved in rational thought and thinking and planning and action is

439
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,940
always trying to plan what should I do and then implement that action and the basal ganglia are

440
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,590
intimately involved in that discussion

441
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,850
there's a reciprocal loop of communication between basal ganglia and cortex.

442
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,900
The basal ganglia has one set of connections to the cortex

443
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:34,410
and the cortex back to the basal ganglia that facilitates go, it facilitates action.

444
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,860
And the molecule the neuromodulator, dopamine triggers the activation of go

445
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,900
it tends to make us want to do more things, it tends to make us bias toward action.

446
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,030
By the way that dopamine

447
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,870
binds to something called the D one receptors is a particular type of dopamine receptor.

448
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,290
For those of you that want to know, the nogo pathway, the pathway in the basal ganglia

449
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,930
and cortex that suppresses action

450
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,390
involves dopamine binding to this other receptor called the D two receptor.

451
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,600
Now, D one D two receptors, you can't just consciously decide

452
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,170
oh, I only want my D one receptors in my D two receptors to be active

453
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,260
you have to think about which sorts of states of mind and body

454
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,820
facilitate go and which ones facilitate no go.

455
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,440
Now, this is critically important because doing focused work

456
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:35,070
accessing plasticity and learning, involve doing certain things and not doing others.

457
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,690
So here's how it works.

458
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,090
And here's how I apply it on a daily basis.

459
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,880
Because I tend to be most alert, first thing mid morning or so.

460
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,730
And then I generally will have my caffeine mid morning

461
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,870
my peak of alertness in the early part of the day

462
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,650
is occurring for me sometime between 930 and 11am.

463
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,190
That's just me.

464
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,190
Other people might experience that immediately after rolling out of bed

465
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,930
they might be wide awake and ready to go.

466
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,200
Which case they should be cautious about throwing caffeine in the mix

467
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,420
because it's going to make them very, very alert.

468
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:16,830
There are three sort of levels of autonomic arousal of alertness that bias us more toward go, No Go

469
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,730
or both.

470
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,730
And this relates to a question that I've gotten now hundreds of times from you

471
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,000
in the comment section for this podcast, which is

472
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,620
is it better for me to listen to music in the background while I work and learn

473
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,930
or should I have complete silence?

474
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,900
And the answer is it depends.

475
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,880
But it doesn't depend randomly on who you are, or even necessarily time of day.

476
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,770
It depends on your overall overall level of autonomic arousal.

477
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,840
And it depends because autonomic arousal level of alertness biases

478
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,880
the extent to which we are more prone to goes to action or to know goes to suppress action.

479
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,160
Dopamine is this molecule that swimming around and is going to buy us one or the other responses.

480
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,970
So here's how it works.

481
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,260
Let's say, I'm very alert, maybe I got a particularly good night's sleep the night before

482
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,030
I had a little too much coffee.

483
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,890
And I'm going to sit down to some work.

484
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,020
The thing to know, and what I always tell myself is when I'm very alert

485
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,290
I am very prone to go to action.

486
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:30,420
But I'm also prone to not know go right, I'm not going to be very good at suppressing action.

487
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,600
So those are two different things being bias toward action and being bias

488
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,600
towards suppressing action are two different things.

489
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,260
Okay.

490
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,220
So those push pull toward action suppress action.

491
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,350
So when you're very alert, the tendency is for everything to be a stimulus.

492
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,740
This is why when people say, well, should I just take a drug like

493
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,190
that will increase my level of epinephrine and alertness will that help me learn better?

494
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,650
No, because it will make you do things

495
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:00,480
but it will also make you less good at suppressing actions that you need to suppress.

496
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:06,360
So if I'm very alert, particularly alert for me, and I recognize what that state is, of course

497
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,220
because everyone will be different, I know what it is for me, then I want silence for learning.

498
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,950
I want it shut down my internet, which I do

499
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,480
I sometimes use a program that I believe is a free program called freedom

500
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,370
where it actually locks you out of the internet for a particular time.

501
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,860
They're not a sponsor of the podcast, I just happened to use it.

502
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,450
Um, there's another version of freedom where you go to the wireless thing, and you turn it off

503
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,770
you disconnect from the wireless.

504
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:35,460
That's the other one, although many people have a hard time not reactivating it.

505
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,530
So I'm trying to shut down the the go pathway towards distraction.

506
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,820
And the other thing that I'll do is I'll generally turn off my phone

507
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,470
put the phone outside in the car, or in really extreme cases, I'll put it I'll throw it up on the roof

508
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,590
which is hard for me to retrieve so that I can't get to it.

509
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,420
So if I'm very alert, I'm aware that I will have a bias toward action.

510
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,760
It'll be hard for me to suppress non action, but it's very nonspecific.

511
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,170
Because the next kind of level down of alertness, or autonomic arousal is clear, calm and focused

512
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:16,590
where we have that kind of sweet spot between our willingness to pursue action

513
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,760
we're in a mode of go.

514
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,390
And it's not always physical action, but it can be pursuing hard bouts of learning.

515
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,310
But that our ability to suppress is also very good.

516
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,980
And this is because and I don't want to get into too many details.

517
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,410
Because of the way that dopamine competes for

518
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,910
these dopamine one receptors in the go pathway and dopamine to receptors in the nogo pathway.

519
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,090
They're always in this kind of push pull.

520
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,380
And so there is a sweet spot.

521
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,330
And that sweet spot isn't flow

522
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,990
where it isn't some sort of state where all of a sudden things come naturally to us

523
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,680
the state that we're trying to achieve that's optimal for learning is one in which

524
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,320
we have the energy and focus to pursue, but we also have the energy and focus to suppress action.

525
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,550
So the basal ganglia are kind of working in a perfect kind of singsong II manner

526
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,530
you know, through this parallel pathway.

527
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,570
Now, as we get tired, or as we round out in ultradian cycle of about 90 minutes

528
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,300
what happens is our fatigue, even if it's not a physical fatigue that makes us want to go to sleep

529
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,640
but our mental fatigue starts to accumulate

530
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,070
because these pathways of go nogo are actually very metabolically consuming.

531
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:26,490
So what I recognize is that as I start to falter, I have a harder time engaging and going

532
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:33,090
I also know are going toward the goal rather, I also know that my reflex

533
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,100
toward actions that are unrelated to the learning are also going to start increasing

534
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,410
because I'm not going to be able to suppress the

535
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,400
I'm not gonna be able to suppress action and activate the nogo pathway.

536
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,600
So if this all sounds like a mouthful, let's make it very simple for you, when you are very alert

537
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:54,450
the best situation for learning is going to be silence, it's going to be complete quiet.

538
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,950
If you are low arousal, and you're tired, and you're kind of sleepy

539
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,450
a lot of people find that having some background chatter and some background noise

540
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,270
can help elevate their level of autonomic arousal.

541
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,390
And that's because our auditory system and our visual system

542
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,080
are linked and are part of really what's called the salience network

543
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,660
which is that we're always scanning our environment for things.

544
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,050
And when we have a lot of things in our environment to scan

545
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,420
generally our level of alertness goes up.

546
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,830
This is why environments that are very stark or have very little

547
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,550
or very few objects in them tend to make us feel kind of calm.

548
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,890
Because our salience network kind of shuts off.

549
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,190
A lot of people don't like that, they'll go to a meditation retreat, retreat

550
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,240
or they'll go into an environment where there's very little clutter, especially city people

551
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,270
and all of a sudden, they start feeling really, really anxious.

552
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,380
And that's because their internal level of autonomic arousal is really high and it's not being

553
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,510
occupied by all this stuff to pay attention to.

554
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,030
And so their salience network starts to turn inward

555
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:54,090
they move from extra reception to interoception.

556
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,740
They're not looking outside themselves

557
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,380
they're looking inside themselves and there's a lot of noise in there.

558
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:05,880
So as a rule of thumb, if you tend to be kind of on the high level of alertness and kind of anxiety

559
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,010
and I'm not talking about clinical levels of anxiety, but you tend to be pretty high energy

560
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,450
well, then you are definitely going to benefit more in a learning bout

561
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:20,130
from learning to go as well as activate the nogo pathway.

562
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,750
And that requires a lot of energy.

563
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,000
And when you have a lot of distractions in your environment

564
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,360
there's a high probability that you're gonna be distracted from the learning.

565
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,920
Now, some people are just naturally more calm, they're like my Bulldog Costello

566
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,590
who's exceedingly calm, they're pretty mellow

567
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,380
they're kind of clear common focus all of the time.

568
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,010
And those people actually are going to be less flammable

569
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,970
they're not going to be yanked around by background noise, or they're not going to be around

570
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,760
you know, bothered from their learning or from their studying

571
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,400
by a clanging of a pot from somebody in the kitchen.

572
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,270
So each one of us generally tends to ride up and down this autonomic ladder, so to speak

573
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:03,180
at different times a day for most people three hours after waking those three hours

574
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,440
not three hours on the mark.

575
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,550
But that three hour been tends to be the period in which they're most alert throughout the day

576
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,140
except I'll tell you later about a unique time right before sleep in which you're also very

577
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,760
very alert naturally.

578
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,300
So that morning, three hours is quite vital.

579
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,920
Now, many of you might ask about exercise and when to exercise.

580
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,830
I think I may have mentioned this on a previous podcast episode

581
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,400
but the research shows that at least for performance, afternoon

582
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,160
exercise might be better in terms of avoiding injury, etc.

583
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,260
But in terms of rising body temperatures

584
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,610
they it and matching body temperature to mental alertness, etc

585
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,520
it's pretty clear that exercising early in the day not only biases us towards waking up earlier

586
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,500
but that it also triggers the release of things like epinephrine and other neuromodulators

587
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:57,570
that lend itself to a situation where we have heightened levels of arousal and mental acuity

588
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,330
in the late morning and even into the afternoon.

589
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,350
This can be very good because if you want to restrict most of your focus

590
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,850
learning to the early part of the day

591
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,550
exercising early in the day does set a neurochemical context or mill you for go

592
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,580
it tends to trigger activation of the go pathway.

593
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,410
And so for those of you like myself

594
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,530
who have a hard time kind of engaging and getting into action early in the day

595
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,440
early morning exercise within an hour of waking

596
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,000
and certainly no later than three hours after waking will give you quote unquote

597
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,260
more energy throughout the day, it will make you feel more biased for action

598
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,610
you won't feel as lethargic.

599
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,320
So in kind of reviewing what I've said up until now I do the morning light thing

600
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I delay my caffeine two hours after waking, and then I generally try and get exercise and

601
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,430
in the first hour or ideally within the first three hours of waking up

602
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,860
and then I'll move into a focus learning bout.

603
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,400
Now.

604
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,790
Some of you wrote to me and said if I exercise early in the day

605
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,420
then I feel a crash afterwards if that exercise is very, very intense

606
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,870
so you're depleting all your glycogen, so you're doing heavy deadlifts, etc.

607
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:04,530
Chances are after you eat, you will start to feel a crash.

608
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,810
So this relates to timing of nutrition.

609
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:12,540
And just as a general rule of thumb, fasted states and low carbohydrate states

610
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,150
I'm not talking about a keto diet round the clock or all week but fasted states

611
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,290
and low carbohydrate states lend themselves to alertness.

612
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,140
And that's because carbohydrates are rich in tryptophan.

613
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,170
And they tend to lend themselves to sleepiness.

614
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,710
Of course, ingesting large amounts of any kind of food

615
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,910
any substance that fills your gut will divert blood to your gut.

616
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:39,600
So if you eat a lot of food, regardless of whether or not it's a lot of carbohydrate or not

617
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,970
you're going to generally feel more sleepy.

618
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,320
Now many people including everyone use food to modulate their levels of autonomic arousal.

619
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,690
And typically eating shifts us more

620
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,890
towards a state of calm and fasting shifts us more toward a state of alertness.

621
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,670
And these are hardwired circuits that relate to the need and desire to find food

622
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,750
which requires action, or the so called rest and digest system which

623
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,980
diverts our resources and our energy towards digestion and makes us feel calm.

624
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:14,700
So I personally rely on water, Mati and black coffee first thing in the day

625
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,330
in order to exercise and get into the first round of work.

626
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,700
If I find that I'm too alert

627
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,860
and then I generally will tend to eat and kind of bring down my level of alertness

628
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,270
and we'll continue working.

629
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,710
Now this isn't a strict thing.

630
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:34,320
And since people asked me what I do, and I'm not dictating that people follow it exactly, of course

631
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,570
or even generally, but I'll just tell you what I do.

632
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,120
It is possible if you're drinking black coffee

633
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,090
and you're or Mati and you're ingesting a lot of water

634
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,960
that you're going to dehydrate yourself somewhat because of excretion of sodium

635
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,320
provided you don't have hypertension, salt is a really good thing.

636
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,410
A lot of people think that they are low on blood sugar because

637
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,460
they're shaky and they can't think or they have a headache when actually they're low in sodium.

638
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,920
And especially if you're drinking a lot of caffeine.

639
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,660
So I'm a big believer We're in salt.

640
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,960
So I drink salt water first thing in the morning because I drink black coffee.

641
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,970
And that keeps my levels of alertness really good.

642
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,630
I always thought that I had messed up blood sugar, you know, shaky hands

643
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,470
and I didn't know what was going on, I drink a little bit of coffee and feel too amped up.

644
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,930
And it turns out that this was a sodium issue.

645
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,670
And if I just drank water with a little bit of sea salt in or even just general table

646
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,810
typical table salt, then I felt rock solid in terms of my blood sugar.

647
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,660
Now, again, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor.

648
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,450
So I don't prescribe anything, but I profess lots of things.

649
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,860
So I don't want people who have diabetes or blood sugar issues to, you know, go off the rails

650
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,720
you're responsible for your health, not me.

651
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,560
But it's an interesting parameter to think about and experiment with

652
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:43,770
you know, provided the your doctor says it's okay, because I think a lot of people

653
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,030
probably just too much sodium, but a lot of people might be sodium deficient, in particular

654
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,850
the people that are fasting, I typically eat my first meal right around midday.

655
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,920
Whether or not I've exercised or not, and the food content there

656
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:04,260
is actually quite important to me. I don't know why this is I don't have a scientific mechanism

657
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,070
for this.

658
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:08,040
But if I eat hot food for lunch, I get sleepy after lunch.

659
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,380
So I generally don't eat hot food for lunch

660
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,240
I might have a little bit of soup or something like that.

661
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,850
But in general, I rely on a low carbohydrate meal, I'll eat meat or salad or some variation

662
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,680
that and nuts in fats and things like that, because of the coline content for focus.

663
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,440
Because the protein is good in my belief.

664
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,260
And because I believe in eating fruits and vegetables, I do that too.

665
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,060
If I've exercised very hard early in the day, I do ingest starches, like oatmeal

666
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,710
or rice and fruit and things like that.

667
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,030
Now, why am I telling you all this?

668
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,610
Because hundreds, if not 1000, people ask me is fasting good for focus.

669
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:44,700
And indeed, fasting will increase alertness.

670
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,900
But if you're so hungry or preoccupied with food, that you can't focus

671
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,350
well, then it's not going to be good for learning, it's only going to be good for agitation.

672
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,940
Well, I'll, I'm just going to mark continue to march through my day.

673
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,470
And this is, of course, what I experienced, some people are quite different.

674
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:06,780
But what I find is around two or 3pm, I start getting a little groggy, a little bit sleepy

675
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:13,350
I will tend to shift my work from work that requires a lot of duration path outcome

676
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,310
really careful analysis and activation of the nogo pathway

677
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,930
meaning I'm trying to suppress the impulse to look at my phone or answer email or do other things.

678
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,380
This is why I haven't emailed you back until three in the afternoon, by the way

679
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,990
are responding to your text messages, whoever you are out there.

680
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,220
Around early afternoon, I find I can do kind of typical, more mundane tasks

681
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:41,700
because those tasks are required less, they have require less cognitive load.

682
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,630
And they can be done more or less in and out of sequence.

683
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,480
I can answer a couple email here, maybe answer that email there

684
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,030
I don't have to do it in a pure linear fashion

685
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:54,780
any kind of linear work or learning work is going to take a lot of focus.

686
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,520
And then typically around 4pm or so. I do two things.

687
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,610
Sometimes a little earlier, sometimes a little later, but I do two things.

688
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,400
One is I make sure I hydrate

689
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,180
because if you're exercising and you're eating you need to digest that food etc.

690
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,640
I make sure I hydrate so I drink water.

691
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,220
I try and refrain from drinking coffee in the afternoon.

692
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,810
This is a new thing for me, I sometimes do it but I try to refrain from that.

693
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,910
And then I always do a non sleep deep rest protocol sometime in the afternoon.

694
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:29,280
This is sometimes a 10 minute Yoga nidra type protocol or a 30 minute Yoga nidra type protocol.

695
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,600
These are protocols that I have no relationship to no business relationship to whatsoever.

696
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,070
I've been doing them for years now.

697
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:40,710
They involve listening to a script, we'll provide the links again, although we read them before.

698
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,660
Or I'll do a hypnosis protocol from reverie health, which is my colleague

699
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:52,530
David's beagles website that has these free hypnosis apps or scripts that you can listen to.

700
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,330
And those Take me into a state of really deep rest, sometimes so much

701
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:01,500
so that I fall asleep and I always set an alarm so that I don't sleep for longer than 90 minutes.

702
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,570
But typically, this goes for about 30 minutes.

703
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:09,780
And I do that because for me by about 430 in the afternoon, I'm capable of doing basically nothing.

704
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,310
I am just a complete Costello I can't think I can't do. I can't respond to email

705
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:20,610
I've just completely troughed my ability to function.

706
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:27,840
I personally find it a mistake to at that point down a double espresso and charge really hard.

707
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,380
It just doesn't work for me I end up really disrupting my sleep schedule.

708
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,090
I end up disrupting a lot of different things.

709
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,970
So for me, I do the non sleep deep rest protocol.

710
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,210
It really helps me later when I need to fall asleep.

711
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,330
It helps with all sorts of things, as I mentioned before

712
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,920
but I usually emerge from that a little groggy or feeling like I have

713
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,780
another whole day second when like I could just work, work, work, work work

714
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:55,110
and then I'll do a second bout of learning.

715
00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,360
I'll do some sort of work that either involves linear analysis of some thing

716
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,560
so maybe numerical work or I'm trying to learn something

717
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,180
I generally try and really use those bouts of 90 minute focus energy

718
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,800
after the non sleep depressed.

719
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,710
And as I mentioned in previous episodes, there's a lot of evidence

720
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,970
that these non sleep depressed protocols can enhance and accelerate plasticity.

721
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,810
The most recent and striking

722
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,120
one is the study that we referenced last time in the caption notes is the cell press article

723
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,620
cell reports, great journal was showing that these 20 minute

724
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,780
kind of shallow naps and non sleep deep breaths can facilitate sensory motor learning.

725
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,020
So then I'll go into another learning about that's caffeine free

726
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,050
this learning bout is very different than the than the morning one

727
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,430
this is a workout or learning bout that's more in the clear common focus regime.

728
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:51,660
Because I've come out of this non sleep depressed, I'm not ingesting caffeine

729
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,510
because I want to make sure that I can sleep later that night really well.

730
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,740
And this tends to be more when I do creative type work.

731
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,870
Now, creativity is a topic that we're going to spend the entire month on coming up soon.

732
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,930
But creativity is a very interesting state of mind in which we're taking existing elements

733
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:16,860
things that we already know, and rearranging them in ways that are novel, I'd say, well, da

734
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,870
that's what creativity is.

735
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,210
But creativity has two parts.

736
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,370
It has a creative discovery mode, where you're kind of shuffling things

737
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:31,170
around in a very relaxed way and kind of being playful or exploring different configurations.

738
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,570
And then creativity also has an absolutely linear implementation mode

739
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,200
in which you take the idea or the design you've come up with

740
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,530
and you create something very rope robust and concrete.

741
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,440
And so creativity is really a two part thing.

742
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:52,260
And the first part of actively exploring different configurations, sometimes in a playful way

743
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:58,980
sometimes in a, in a way that's almost random and just kind of exploring that

744
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,700
state is definitely facilitated by being relaxed and almost sleepy.

745
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,720
That is not a state that I personally can access very well, early in the day

746
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,510
I've tried to access it coming out of sleep, because no one would say

747
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:14,730
well, you're still sleepy early in the day, it just doesn't work.

748
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,820
Most of what I write down most of what I do is complete garbage.

749
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,230
And so what I found is there's this block in the afternoon of about 90 minutes where

750
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:26,910
I can do creative type writing or creative type imagination of

751
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,180
scientific ideas or experiments we

752
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,090
want to do science might not seem like a creative endeavor to many of you

753
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:36,480
but it is has a lot of imagining what if this

754
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:40,530
or we could combine that and thinking of novel concepts or ways of arranging things.

755
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,490
So when you find yourself in that kind of clear, calm and focused mode

756
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,810
creative works tend to come about very well in those regimes.

757
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,980
I know that a lot of people out there rely on substances to access creative states.

758
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:58,650
I'm not a marijuana user, it's just not the drug for me, for a variety of reasons.

759
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,450
I'm not a drinker, it's not the not the substance, for me for a variety of reasons.

760
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,860
You know, I'm not a cop, I'm not here to tell people what they should do or shouldn't do.

761
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,990
The problem with using substances to access creativity is that generally

762
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:15,210
the ones that the substances that relax

763
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,500
people will allow them to get into that creative brainstorming mode

764
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:23,700
but not so good at the linear implementation mode.

765
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,970
You know, the other day, I was remarking with a friend, that there's some ads

766
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:34,410
some advertisements that I've seen over the years, that are just incredible.

767
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:35,790
I'll just tell you what they are.

768
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,580
So there's not cryptic or any, I'm revealing my taste here, there's a one

769
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,710
there's a particular perfume ad that spike Jones made that is just amazing.

770
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,650
It's just I'll put a link to it, because it's just so cool.

771
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,920
And it's just so and it has an there's I don't want to give away the end.

772
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,820
But it has a feature of it that is particularly interesting to me, as a neuroscientist

773
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,410
and is just so cool.

774
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,750
And I cuz I grew up in the skateboarding thing.

775
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,790
I knew a little bit about spikes, movies and skateboarding.

776
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:04,290
And he's, of course made a lot of very impressive popular movies as well, full length features.

777
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,300
I don't know him personally.

778
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,050
So this isn't a, you know, plug, not that he needs my endorsement for anything at all.

779
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,690
But the The amazing thing about this advertisement is it's a kind of

780
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,530
it's a collection of things that you would never really think would be combined.

781
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:23,580
And it involves different speeds of motion and all sorts of effects.

782
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,550
I mean, it's like a real classic like Spike Jonze kind of delivery.

783
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,170
But what's incredible is when when you think about not just

784
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,220
the fact that someone had to imagine that but to actually implement the steps

785
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,810
in order to create that, when you see this, you'll realize that was a ton of work

786
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:45,240
you can't just put that together randomly and so a lot of people not spike, clearly.

787
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:51,270
But a lot of people who can who have an incredible mind for ideas and novel

788
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,130
novel arrangements of things.

789
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,900
They are great at accessing that state but not so good at accessing the implementation state.

790
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,840
And then there it's also true that a lot A lot of people

791
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,170
and some who tend to fall on what we would call the kind of like more

792
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,970
Asperger's or autism end of the spectrum are very good at linear implementation.

793
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:11,220
Now, I'm not talking about all forms of autism, of course

794
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,860
I'm sensitive to the fact that there are many forms on the spectrum.

795
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,520
But some people are very good at linear implementation.

796
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,630
And that's a separate state from a creative states.

797
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,740
So that afternoon block is when I try and access the

798
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,280
freer kind of looser mindset that's associated with the fatigue

799
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,900
that comes later in the afternoon.

800
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:36,180
And for some of you, that state that favors creativity

801
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:39,000
and creative learning might be better in the morning

802
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,720
I don't know you're going to have to decide for some of you you're going to be late shifted

803
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,130
some of you are going to be morning shifted

804
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,880
but where we have alertness generally we are good at linear implementation

805
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,180
we're good at activating the novo pathway and suppressing action.

806
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,790
And we are good at at pursuing particular goals and, and strategy implementation

807
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,080
and where we tend to be more relaxed, and we tend to be almost in a kind of Sleepy mode.

808
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,590
So for me coming out of one of these non sleep deep rest modes, or or sleep

809
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,690
that's when we tend to be better at novel configurations of existing elements

810
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,980
which is creativity.

811
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,120
And this brings about a question that I get all the time, which is what about psychedelics?

812
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:24,300
So I am going to talk to some experts on psychedelics, I hope to bring some of them in

813
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,520
actually speaking on people coming in or

814
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:30,210
creatures coming in. A creature that's definitely not on psychedelics

815
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,700
who doesn't need a is Costello and he just arrived.

816
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,730
He seems to be in a sleepy state most all the time.

817
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,900
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

818
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:38,370
You come in.

819
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:44,190
Yeah, he's working on his 15th sleep deep rest episode of the day

820
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,940
which is generally followed by a 10 to 12 hour deep rest episodes

821
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,360
almost exclusively comprised of RAM.

822
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,660
And I know this because his eyes are open because they're so droopy can't close them all away

823
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:55,980
and His eyes are going like this.

824
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,690
And he's going down for the count.

825
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,200
So yeah, nice and big yawn.

826
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,020
Okay, so psychedelics.

827
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:08,160
First of all, I want to be very clear, I am neither a proponent.

828
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:12,720
Nor am I somebody who rejects the potential role of psychedelics.

829
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,880
I do, however, think that psychedelics can be particularly hazardous

830
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,240
for people who have pre existing psychological issues

831
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:28,170
and are not working with a Board Certified psychiatrist or physician, as well as for essentially

832
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,490
all kids

833
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:34,650
I think that the young brain is basically in its own psychedelic state and just naturally.

834
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:41,610
And it all kidding aside, I think that the young brain is so subject to neural plasticity

835
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,240
that drugs which like psychedelics, which are very powerful

836
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,180
can be detrimental to the developing brain.

837
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,320
That's just my stance.

838
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,380
If anyone disagrees with me, I'd be happy to chat with you about it.

839
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,470
In a in a polite and discourse

840
00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:01,860
I'll be happy to listen as well as tell you more why I believe that based on the data, I mentioned

841
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,640
psychedelics, because many of you asked, here's the deal with psychedelics

842
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,260
at least here's how they work.

843
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:15,240
In a nutshell, psychedelics, were thought to unleash sensory processing.

844
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:18,780
And to make it less filtered, we have a lot of different inputs from our eyes, from our ears

845
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,080
from our nose, from a taste, etc, that are coming in all the time in parallel.

846
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,850
And we have mechanisms

847
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,900
that suppress some of those and allow us to only focus on things that are happening visually

848
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,860
generally we don't have synesthesia is unless some of us happen to have synesthesia

849
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,260
we don't blend what we see with what we hear in a way that is confusing to us.

850
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:42,030
We know what's making sounds, and we know what is a visual stimulus.

851
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,800
On psychedelics, people report being able to smell colors or to, you know, hear trees, etc.

852
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,660
And that's because there's a lot of sensory blending.

853
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,020
However, that's led to the misconception, that sensory blending itself is a creative process.

854
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,960
There's nothing creative about sensory blending.

855
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:08,940
Now, there's the essence of a creative process is that some novel configuration of elements

856
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,590
whether or not it's notes on a piano, or whether it's words on a page, whether or not it's numbers

857
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:20,250
or whether or not it's movement, that some way in which those are configured in some new way

858
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:27,090
that the algorithm, the way in which they are configured makes sense to the observer.

859
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,620
And this is a key thing, it seems to me that when people report their psychedelic experiences

860
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,610
it makes a lot more sense to the person who experiences it than to the observer.

861
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,990
And so creative works, by definition

862
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,670
are new ways of configuring things that lend themselves to a bigger

863
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:49,350
bigger or greater or deeper or novel understanding on the part of the observer.

864
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,830
And just sensory blending is not going to accomplish that.

865
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,100
Now.

866
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,790
It is true.

867
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:55,950
And there's a great review in the journal cell.

868
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,010
Excellent journal about how psychedelics work, and it turns out

869
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,830
they don't just work By allowing for more sensory blending, they do

870
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,370
because of the way that they activate certain serotonin receptors, etc

871
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,810
they do lend themselves to more lateral connectivity between different brain areas

872
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,850
more novel associations.

873
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,740
So in principle, in principle, I should say not necessarily in practice, but in principle

874
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,920
they do allow different areas of the brain

875
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,030
maybe even the two sides of the brain to communicate more broadly than they would normally.

876
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,440
So that has certain elements that speak to creativity.

877
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:37,200
But it can't simply be the case that psychedelics are the portal to creativity

878
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,690
because creativity, as I mentioned before, involves not just novel associations

879
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,150
and a breaking of kind of space time rules.

880
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:51,540
It also involves reconfiguring things such that the new space time rule that one comes up with

881
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,690
is interesting, stimulating and kind of, in many cases, delightful to the observer.

882
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:03,510
And that's why many claims that you know, psychedelics, open plasticity

883
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,520
or they increase creativity.

884
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,500
That's not sufficient.

885
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,990
For me personally, I'm curious about does it not just open the creative thinking process

886
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,640
this novel configuration process?

887
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,960
But does it also lend itself to the implementation of creative works?

888
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,820
And the answer is no.

889
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:25,410
In most cases, it has nothing to do with creative implementation.

890
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,220
Now, I think that there may come a time

891
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,410
and certainly there are clinical trials that are happening now

892
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,920
where psychedelics are leveraged toward particular clinical goals.

893
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:38,790
And I want to tip my hat to the work at Johns Hopkins that's happening now

894
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:40,320
which really lends itself

895
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,060
to the idea that early preliminary data and some of the papers are coming out

896
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,360
they're really fantastic, showing that there may be some

897
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,190
excellent roles for certain psychedelics in certain clinical contexts.

898
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:58,380
These are clinical studies done with a psychiatrist present, that is authorized to do that

899
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,990
that can help people through depression and trauma, etc.

900
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:04,710
And we're going to spend a lot of time talking about that, including with some of those

901
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,300
those folks running those studies.

902
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,590
So we can look forward to that.

903
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:13,230
So all of this is to say that, no, I don't take psychedelics to access creative states.

904
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,800
That's not where I think the major role

905
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,730
the important role of psychedelics might show up if it's going to for humanity

906
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,750
I think that it may have these important roles in the clinical context

907
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,820
provided it's done legally and safely.

908
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,670
I think that, that the creative process being a two stage process means that

909
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:39,480
I am personally best served by having this period of nonlinear exploration of concepts

910
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,970
whatever it is I happen to be working on in the afternoon, but then I'll actually shelve that work

911
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,320
I'll just set it aside.

912
00:57:46,350 --> 00:57:49,260
And then I'll revisit it the next day or even the next day

913
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,590
to see whether or not that the work itself is ready for deliberate linear implementation

914
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,440
which I would want to do during when these high highly focused states.

915
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:04,410
So the long and short way of saying this is that when we're very alert, do linear type of operations

916
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:10,980
when we tend to be more sleepy and more relaxed, that's when creative works can first be conceived

917
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:14,850
but their implementation requires high levels of alertness.

918
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,130
Now, that gets us more to the kind of late afternoon, evening.

919
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:25,950
Now I am, as I mentioned before, I'm a proponent of getting sunlight in the evening as well.

920
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,700
This is a critical thing that I have not mentioned before.

921
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,440
Here's how it works.

922
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,730
Many people now have heard me say getting light early in the day is important.

923
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,770
But that will advance one's clock, it'll make you want to get up earlier the next day.

924
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:44,280
By getting late in the evening, it accomplishes two things.

925
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,450
For me, first of all

926
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,440
it makes sure that I don't get up too early that I'm not waking up at three or four in the morning

927
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,790
because it's going to shift my clock, it's going to delay it a little bit.

928
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,560
And so this is really important.

929
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,310
If you want to keep your schedule on a normal routine

930
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:04,770
on a regular 24 hour cycle and not have your circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness

931
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:05,940
drifting all over the place.

932
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,390
And you want some

933
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:10,770
predictability to how your mind is going to work in order to optimize Learning and Performance.

934
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,320
Well, then you need to get morning like any evening light

935
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,860
the morning light is going to advance my clock make my system want to get up earlier.

936
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,670
And the evening light is going to delay my clock a little bit so that on average

937
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,010
it kind of bookends my circadian mechanisms.

938
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,570
And I'll basically want to go to sleep at more or less the same time each night and wake up

939
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:30,000
more or less at the same time each morning.

940
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,410
That's how it works.

941
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,420
And that's a hardwired mechanism.

942
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,360
That's not some subjective thing that I tell myself.

943
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,100
That's a hardwired mechanism.

944
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,590
So that gets us to the evening.

945
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,360
And generally in the evening

946
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,470
I'll get that light by going outside or sometimes I'll do it by turning up artificial lights

947
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,100
brightly

948
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,550
and then I'll start to dim them for the evening because as I've mentioned many times before

949
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,360
and I'm not going to belabor the point, you want to minimize your light exposure

950
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:56,250
especially overhead bright light exposure

951
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,050
regardless of whether it's blue light or not in the evening from about 10pm to 4am.

952
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:04,530
Some of you asked, wait, I thought it was 11pm to 4am?

953
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,410
Well, it is, but 10pm to 4am is even better.

954
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,730
That is just that when I originally said 10pm to 4am

955
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,580
people like that it's impossible for most people to adhere to.

956
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,290
So for me, it's screens off.

957
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,420
It's dim lights.

958
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,140
And that's what favors falling asleep and a good night's sleep for me.

959
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,660
Since we were talking about food earlier

960
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:29,460
I'll just revisit a little bit of what I said before my evening meal tends to be more carbohydrate

961
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,030
rich more, if I have proteins, there'll be like eggs, fish

962
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:37,740
or chicken or something of that sort or no protein, and I high carbohydrate.

963
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:43,140
So I'm not one of these people that keto or high, high meat only or anything like that.

964
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:46,650
Remember, fasting and low carbohydrate states facilitate alertness.

965
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,450
Carbohydrate rich foods, facilitate calmness and sleepiness

966
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,480
they'd stimulate the release of tryptophan and the transition to sleep.

967
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,430
So that's why I do them late in the day.

968
01:00:56,550 --> 01:01:01,080
Also, if you've exercised early in the day, especially if it's weight bearing exercise

969
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,900
or everything's weight bearing size, I suppose unless you're an astronaut

970
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,430
but and you're in space.

971
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,450
But if you're early in the day, exercising with weights, or you're doing a long run

972
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,330
or something sooner or later, you need to replenish glycogen.

973
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:15,720
And I realized that the keto nice does out, they're gonna say

974
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,890
Well, you know, glucose gluconeogenesis will allow you to replenish glycogen, etc.

975
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:23,640
I'm just going to call out the lie right now.

976
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,380
Because I feel like doing it.

977
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:30,870
And because I think it just hasn't been stated, which is that not everybody

978
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:35,910
but a lot of the people that are proponents of high meat keto diets, fine.

979
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,550
That's fine, if that's what they want to do.

980
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:45,420
And as you recall, I do relatively ketogenic diet during the day too, for alertness or fasting.

981
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:52,020
But a lot of those people can replenish glycogen really well without ingesting carbohydrate

982
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,430
so called gluconeogenesis.

983
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:57,420
And enhanced protein synthesis, because they are hormone enhanced.

984
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,980
And it's just they're been around a while I know what this looks like.

985
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:05,910
They're either thyroid enhanced or hormone enhanced, and I don't pass any judgment.

986
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,240
But when you look at people who look amazing on keto

987
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:17,490
and are able to have a lot of energy and replenish their glycogen on keto, they are, in many cases

988
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:18,360
not all.

989
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,340
But in many cases, they're hormone enhanced.

990
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,050
They're taking exogenous hormones, that allow them to synthesize

991
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:29,520
and repair muscle in ways that people who aren't taking those exogenous hormones can't

992
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:30,690
This is not just true of the men.

993
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,790
By the way, this is also true of the women.

994
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,350
And this is a whole discussion unto itself

995
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,380
probably not directly related to this month of the podcast.

996
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:40,890
So I don't mind that people do this.

997
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,720
But one problem is when people are following ketogenic diets all the way through to sleep

998
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,300
and they have trouble with sleep, or they're doing long bouts of fasting

999
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,830
and they're having trouble falling asleep.

1000
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,270
That makes sense is because their autonomic arousal is tilted towards epinephrine release

1001
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,210
norepinephrine release, and dopamine release.

1002
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:00,810
So they have a lot of energy, but they have a hard time calming down and getting into deep sleep.

1003
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,970
I tend to achieve that state using carbohydrates, and it also replenishes glycogen.

1004
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,970
So again, you know, I'm not trying to draw any fire.

1005
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:14,970
But if I do, I'd be happy to have a conversation about all that, again, no judgment.

1006
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:19,410
But I think that most people out there are not aware of some of the other variables.

1007
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:21,750
Remember, good science is about isolating variables.

1008
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,270
And so oftentimes what we're seeing in social media

1009
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:27,030
is we're getting presented single variables

1010
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:30,540
and we're not seeing the full context of the other variables that are being manipulated.

1011
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,310
So I eat pasta, and rice and vegetables and things like that in the evening.

1012
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:40,800
Also, I just find, maybe I'm becoming one of the last people that does that, although I hope not

1013
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,450
I hope there are others out there like me.

1014
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:48,030
But I just from all the literature speaks to the fact that carbohydrates not only do that

1015
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,850
but they also help maintain healthy thyroid function, etc.

1016
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:52,140
So that's my bias.

1017
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:52,860
That's what I do.

1018
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,910
I do avoid caffeine and whatnot in the evening, I do take supplements

1019
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,570
and I'll be happy at some point to put out the complete list of supplements that I put out

1020
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,500
take out there.

1021
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,190
But in general, these are the core things that I do.

1022
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:08,940
And they relate to a lot of the questions that that you've been asking, over time.

1023
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,010
The next pieces of scientific data

1024
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,280
that I'm going to describe as a very important piece of scientific data

1025
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,910
for sake of understanding how to optimize your brain and access sleep

1026
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:21,570
it also can help and avoid a lot of anxiety issues.

1027
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,250
And these relate to data from Charles Eisler Dr.

1028
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,370
He's an MD Chuck's icers lab at Harvard Medical School

1029
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:33,960
he's run a sleep lab out of Harvard Medical School for a long time now does very impressive work.

1030
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:40,980
And what he's shown is that the peak output of the circadian clock for wakefulness, in other words

1031
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,120
the peak of our wakefulness, and the suppression of the sleep signal

1032
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,420
actually happens very late in the day.

1033
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:55,290
So we have this trough of activity and body temperature is lowest right before waking.

1034
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,880
Then as we wake up, our body temperature goes up and into the afternoon, it continues to go up, up, up, up

1035
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,270
up And then it tends to fall in the evening and towards bedtime.

1036
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:10,440
But there's a brief blip, of release of peptides and other substances from the

1037
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,780
from the sleep centers in the brain

1038
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,860
and the super cosmetic nucleus that that sleep centers this preoptic area

1039
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,770
that if you want to look that up this preoptic

1040
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,760
area not far from the circadian clock that signals the peak of alertness and wakefulness

1041
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,310
about an hour before bedtime.

1042
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:28,350
And you say, well, that's really weird.

1043
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:32,580
But a lot of people get into bed, they're ready to go to sleep, and they're wide awake

1044
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,610
and they think this is an unnatural thing, or there's something wrong with them.

1045
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,660
And actually, it's not this, it's believed.

1046
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,900
I don't know, again, I wasn't consulted the design phase.

1047
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:49,200
But this is, it's believed, is a signal that is helpful to human beings to start gathering

1048
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:53,160
up resources and securing themselves for a night sleep during which we

1049
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:53,700
you know

1050
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:58,260
historically were very vulnerable to attack from other humans and from animals and so forth.

1051
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:03,030
And so that desire to run around and clean the kitchen or organize things

1052
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:06,750
or just a general feeling of internal anxiety late in the evening

1053
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:11,940
that's a natural blip that naturally passes after about 45 to 60 minutes.

1054
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,590
Now, that's often the time

1055
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,160
when people start stressing about the fact that they have something to do the next day

1056
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,550
and they worry about not being able to sleep, and it can cascade into a whole set of things.

1057
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:25,470
So another thing that I do throughout my day is, I know that early day

1058
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,900
I'm going to be alert afternoon, I'm going to be kind of sleepy.

1059
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:32,460
And then as the evening comes around, in addition to doing all the other things I'm doing

1060
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:37,290
I anticipate a peak in alertness and activity

1061
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:41,100
and I don't worry about it. I use that perhaps to get organized for the next day.

1062
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,860
But basically, I just go through, if I'm going to do anything

1063
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:48,570
it's gonna be very mundane tasks like cleaning or things that require almost zero effort.

1064
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:51,000
And that probably speaks to my cleaning abilities too.

1065
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:57,960
But the fact of the matter is, we don't just go drift off into sleep, there's this blip of alertness

1066
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,770
right before sleep that I hope just cognitively knowing about will be helpful to people.

1067
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:06,690
And that raises yet another theme that I think is going to be very important

1068
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:15,450
which is physiological mechanisms like these changes in alertness, or using breathing tools

1069
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:19,980
something we'll talk about in future episodes to shift our levels of autonomic arousal.

1070
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:25,380
Those are concrete, biological phenomena, so is fasting

1071
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,050
fasting will increase alertness that way, so is caffeine

1072
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,230
not everybody susceptible to caffeine to the same degree or others.

1073
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:33,390
But it's a physiological mechanisms.

1074
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,990
We know the receptors, we know the ligands, as they're called, which bind to the receptors.

1075
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:38,400
We know the mechanisms.

1076
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,930
They involve cortisol and epinephrine.

1077
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,250
Those are the sorts of things that I personally try and leverage

1078
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:47,070
toward my learning and optimization of my brain.

1079
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:51,480
And my activity, doing physical activity early in the day, for instance

1080
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,580
tends to give us a longer duration

1081
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,520
wake up signal and tends to accelerate waking up early in the day.

1082
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,770
That's why working out late in the day can sometimes cause people to have trouble falling asleep

1083
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,310
it will also phase delay, you make it so that you want to wake up later The next day

1084
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,510
it's not just because you're tired

1085
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:08,970
it's because you shifted your clock with activity and temperature.

1086
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:14,220
Many people ask me about subjective tools for plasticity.

1087
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,870
What about visualization?

1088
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,740
You know, can we just imagine doing a particular activity?

1089
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:22,620
Will that help us get better at that activity?

1090
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,100
There are some evidence that visualization can do that.

1091
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:26,820
It's true.

1092
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,270
But here's the important distinction.

1093
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:33,930
And here's why I personally don't do much deliberate visualization.

1094
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:37,619
First of all, I get my best ability

1095
01:08:37,829 --> 01:08:41,549
or achieved my best ability to visualize things when I'm in kind of a sleepy state.

1096
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:42,269
I don't know why.

1097
01:08:42,269 --> 01:08:47,429
But that's when I'm able to direct my brain towards internal visualization with my eyes closed.

1098
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:49,049
And generally, I fall asleep.

1099
01:08:49,049 --> 01:08:51,329
And I can't remember anything that I was thinking about before.

1100
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:56,609
Some people and these are work that was done many years ago by Roger Shepard and by others

1101
01:08:56,849 --> 01:09:00,239
Roger was at Stanford, but and other labs have done this too, of course

1102
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:07,049
of rotating objects physically in their mind as a way of improving or looking at the speed of

1103
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,629
spatial calculations, and so forth.

1104
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,939
Some people are very good at visualization, they can close their eyes

1105
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,759
and they can just see objects and rotate them deliberately, etc.

1106
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:23,009
A lot of people like me, when we start doing that our mind drifts too easily.

1107
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,109
But I like to think I'm a reasonably focused person in the waking state.

1108
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:33,959
So visualization has, it's interesting because I think people are very attracted to the idea

1109
01:09:34,139 --> 01:09:37,049
that they can just think about something and then get better at it that way.

1110
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:42,959
And it's probably true, if you can be very linear in the way that you visualize things.

1111
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:44,429
So I won't repeat that.

1112
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:46,829
I think visualization does have certain power

1113
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:52,169
if you can remain very linear and deliberate and focused in the visualization.

1114
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,929
But many people like myself who are challenged

1115
01:09:55,169 --> 01:10:00,809
with maintaining that linear focus with eyes closed and inverted visualization

1116
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:03,299
they don't get much out of visualization.

1117
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,359
And I think the data on performance really supports that.

1118
01:10:06,509 --> 01:10:10,499
Now, there are examples where for instance, people injure one limb

1119
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:15,569
and then they will exercise the intact limb, or or the the non injured limb rather.

1120
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:17,759
And they will visualize the opposite limb.

1121
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:21,749
Sometimes there's even the use of mirror boxes so that let's say, my left limb is injured.

1122
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:26,219
I'm maintaining activity with my right limb, but I'm using a mirror box.

1123
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:29,999
So it looks like my left limb is working well, yes, there's some top down or

1124
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,829
you know, or feedback mechanisms

1125
01:10:32,129 --> 01:10:36,599
that support the idea that the injured limb can rehabilitate more quickly, etc.

1126
01:10:36,959 --> 01:10:39,719
But those are fairly elaborate schemes.

1127
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:42,269
These aren't the kinds of I don't have mirror boxes around my house.

1128
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,750
I think these are our specialized circumstances.

1129
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:51,300
They're a little bit like the the examples that we see in the news where Oh, so and so has a stroke

1130
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,460
and then spontaneously speaks a new language.

1131
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:00,540
I don't know what the answer to that is I it shows that the brain has associative networks that are

1132
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,670
typically suppressed, and those can be unleashed.

1133
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:03,720
But you certainly

1134
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:07,050
don't want to go out and give yourself a stroke deliberately to try and unmask some skill.

1135
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:12,300
Because there's just no, there's no concrete way to go about that in a way

1136
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,750
that you could really know that you were going to offset the detrimental effects of the stroke.

1137
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,880
In fact, I think it'd be a terrible idea.

1138
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:24,330
So I think what I'm trying to describe is how a typical, I don't know if I'm typical, or normal

1139
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:27,840
I mean, I've been told otherwise, is certainly not normal.

1140
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,280
But in terms of the way that I structure my day, I think that's normal.

1141
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,010
That's pretty normal, I tend to wake up right around, I don't know, somewhere between 530 and 7am

1142
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:41,580
depending on what I've been doing the night before, I tend to go to sleep somewhere around 10 3011

1143
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,900
I tend to have one bout in the morning where I can do really focused hard work.

1144
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,030
And I can really activate

1145
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:52,710
the NGO pathway while also activating the nogo pathway so that I can really stay focused

1146
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,850
but I rely on some tools.

1147
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,180
I have a period in the afternoon where I get sleepy, and kind of out of it.

1148
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,720
Like I think most people and I tend to come out of that within

1149
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:04,320
recognizing the opportunity of that slightly sleepy state for

1150
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:07,440
creative work and for thinking about things in novel ways.

1151
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:13,380
I get like, a couple times a day, I eat low carb during the day, and I don't say hi, but you know

1152
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,990
higher carb, I eat starches in the evening, so in a way I can sleep.

1153
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:25,260
And then I really anticipate that late afternoon peak and alertness, excuse me

1154
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,810
late night peak and alertness that

1155
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:32,520
many people confuse for insomnia or challenges when actually they're

1156
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:34,980
really quite normal in their circadian cycle.

1157
01:12:35,610 --> 01:12:37,080
And then I fall asleep.

1158
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:41,550
And if all goes well, I stay asleep for four or five hours.

1159
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,170
Typically, it's three or four.

1160
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:46,890
And then I wake up, I think I'm like most people, I wake up during the middle of the night.

1161
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,500
Now one thing that I don't think has been discussed a lot

1162
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,040
but one of my colleagues at the Stanford sleep lab tells me is that

1163
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:58,320
every hour and a half or so we all wake up, some of you even look around, believe it or not

1164
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,610
and go right back to sleep.

1165
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:04,140
And you don't recognize it waking up periodically during sleep is the norm.

1166
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,220
It is not abnormal.

1167
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:07,740
I don't know why this isn't been discussed more prominently.

1168
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,940
I tend to wake up and if there's a bright light coming through the blinds

1169
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,990
or if there's some noise upstairs, I've Costello snoring particularly loud

1170
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:20,040
I might get up, I might go use the restroom, I might

1171
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,090
you know, pick up a book and read under low light or something.

1172
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,580
And then I generally fall back asleep and wake up.

1173
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:30,030
Typical time for me again, 530 to 7am in the morning.

1174
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,350
This waking

1175
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:35,190
up in the middle of the night thing as I mentioned at the beginning of the podcast episode today

1176
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:39,900
is not necessarily abnormal, what it probably reflects, is that

1177
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,210
the real time meaning the time that I should go to sleep is probably closer to eight o'clock

1178
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,330
the word midnight was literally supposed to mean mid night

1179
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:53,700
we meant meaning all of us were meant to go to sleep and wake up with the rise

1180
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,740
you know, with the setting and rising of the sun.

1181
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,440
And we know this because this beautiful study from University of Colorado where they took

1182
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:05,850
people out into the wilderness to reset their circadian clocks by way of

1183
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,880
you know, measured by way of melatonin and cortisol.

1184
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:09,900
And they had them

1185
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:14,400
they were completely out of whack from interacting with screens and staying up too late, etc.

1186
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,180
And they basically had them view the sunrise and view the sunset age evening.

1187
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:21,780
And almost all of them not all of the students but all of them

1188
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,640
got onto a schedule where they naturally wanted to go to sleep at sunset and wake up

1189
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,680
around sunrise or just before sunrise

1190
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:32,700
even when they were brought back into a normal artificial light setting.

1191
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,740
So I think that's the natural pattern.

1192
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,960
And we've just deviated from it with artificial lights.

1193
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:42,210
So waking up at 3am or 4am doesn't necessarily mean that there's something screwed up about you

1194
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:47,700
it or that you know, you have anxiety or something although you might the what it

1195
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,680
likely means is that you were supposed to go to bed much

1196
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,880
earlier and because of this asymmetry in the autonomic nervous system where it's much

1197
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:59,940
easier for us to push and to delay our sleep time than it is to accelerate our wakeup time.

1198
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,320
In other words, it's easier to stay up and hang out at the party, even

1199
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,070
if you don't want to be there than it is to wake up when you're exhausted and you're fast asleep.

1200
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:12,240
Most people are pushing through into the

1201
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,290
late hours of the evening and night and going to bed much later than they naturally would want to.

1202
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:24,180
And so I personally don't want to go to bed at 8pm a lot of good things happen between 8pm and 11pm.

1203
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:28,230
And so I want to enjoy those and I push through the the evening hours.

1204
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,490
But as a consequence

1205
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:35,220
I'm running out of melatonin my melatonin release is basically subsided by about three or 4am.

1206
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:35,310
And

1207
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:39,750
so it makes sense that I would wake up. I don't take melatonin for reasons discussed in previous

1208
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:44,160
episodes, I do rely on things like magnesium glycinate

1209
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:48,840
or magnesium three and eight things like theanine, not saying any of you need to take those.

1210
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:51,630
That's just what I happen to take in order to facilitate my sleep.

1211
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,670
And it's been of great benefit to me.

1212
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,040
If I wake up in the middle of the night, and I'm anxious for whatever reason, or my mind is looping

1213
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:00,330
I have a couple rules.

1214
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:05,160
One is, I don't trust anything I think about when I wake up in the middle of the night

1215
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:08,340
any of it unless I've had a magnificent dream and I want to write it down.

1216
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,960
I'll do that every once in a while.

1217
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:13,050
Typically when I go back and read it, it's not at all magnificent.

1218
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:16,440
I can't ever remember coming up with

1219
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:21,360
anything really fantastic in one of my dreams that stuck with me, or that I implemented.

1220
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:26,340
I don't really trust the kind of thinking that happens in those wee hours of the circadian cycle.

1221
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:30,120
For me, there's just nothing either for me terribly creative

1222
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,090
or worth linear implementation at that time.

1223
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:36,120
But one thing that has been very helpful is to

1224
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:40,980
sometimes do one of these non sleep deep breath protocols as a way to go back into sleep.

1225
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:46,050
So hypnosis app by where some of the scripts by Michael Sealy that I've mentioned before

1226
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:50,340
or the reverie health, or a yoga nidra protocol

1227
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,300
those for me have been very useful at helping me turn off

1228
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,420
kind of looping thinking in the middle of the night and fall back asleep.

1229
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,450
In reviewing my schedule for you

1230
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:05,820
just as a context for how to implement certain types of tools for optimizing learning

1231
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:07,410
realize that

1232
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:11,490
it gives the impression that there's a 90 minute bout of learning and work in the morning

1233
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,880
and then a 90 minute bout of creative type work in the afternoon.

1234
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,420
And that's it.

1235
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:19,020
There are a lot of hours in between, of course, and I just want to be very clear

1236
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:25,470
those hours for me are occupied by pretty not mundane tasks, but things that are kind of random.

1237
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:27,450
Those are things like email

1238
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:33,150
or attending to zoom meetings or meeting with colleagues and students and things of that sort.

1239
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,480
I sometimes will read just for sake of my own enrichment.

1240
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,920
I mentioned those 290 minute ballots, because those are the 290 minute ballots

1241
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:46,170
where I'm trying to expand on the mental capacities that I already have there

1242
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:50,910
to really where I'm trying to stretch and grow what I'm able to do on a regular basis reflexively.

1243
01:17:51,030 --> 01:17:55,410
So I want to emphasize that the whole day doesn't just consist of those 290 minute bouts.

1244
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,450
That's not the way my schedule works.

1245
01:17:57,450 --> 01:17:59,130
And that's not the way my lifestyle is arranged

1246
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:01,590
which is fortunate because I enjoy all those other things as well.

1247
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,030
And so for many of you out there who are in school, or have family demands or other demands

1248
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,740
the key is to slot in those brain optimization segments of about 90 minutes

1249
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,680
one or two or maybe more per day, you're trying to slot those in wherever you can amidst your other

1250
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,380
obligations and things that you need to do.

1251
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:24,390
But you want to do that in an intelligent way that's anchored to your biology.

1252
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,790
And then you want to do a number of things which I've talked about today

1253
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,060
in order to optimize those sessions to get the most out of them.

1254
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,800
So as we round up, I acknowledge that once again

1255
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,890
I've covered a huge range of topics related to how to optimize learning, and brain change

1256
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,530
and essentially mental performance.

1257
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:47,010
And I've set that in the context of some biological mechanism

1258
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:51,270
like the basal ganglia go nogo pathways, the circadian autonomic system

1259
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,270
and some of the relationship between

1260
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:58,950
food and fasting in particular types of food and alertness or sleepiness.

1261
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:05,130
Linear focus and strategy implementation is best served by high alert states

1262
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:09,720
although not to alert and how creative states at least the first phase of creativity

1263
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,090
which is the creative arrangement

1264
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:18,750
kind of brainstorming stage is supported by states of relaxation or even slightly sleepy

1265
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:22,800
but the creative implementation is a very linear and focused and deliberate process

1266
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:26,070
much like the highly focused state that I described.

1267
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:30,810
I described how I do these things that just to give you a context, a lot of you asked for

1268
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,420
you know what I do in order to set it within a context

1269
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:36,420
but by no means are these rigid times and ways of doing things.

1270
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:41,250
But I think it's fair to say that what I do has a circadian logic.

1271
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,210
It also has grounding in biological mechanisms.

1272
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:49,470
They're very concrete that we know the cells and mechanisms and neurotransmitters

1273
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:56,280
and then some of them are a little bit headed out into the what we would call kind of emerging or

1274
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:59,070
you know, I don't want to say cutting edge, but maybe the

1275
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,730
front edge of what neuroscience is trying to understand about creativity and so forth.

1276
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:07,440
We those are areas that are just now coming to some clarity.

1277
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,840
And there certainly is still a lot more work to do

1278
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,330
and a lot of different ways to arrange one's routine.

1279
01:20:12,870 --> 01:20:17,250
But hopefully, the tools and practices that I described will be useful to you.

1280
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:22,920
I want to mention that a lot of people ask me about specific tools and practices.

1281
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,040
They asked me about Wim Hof breathing about ice baths have

1282
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:29,190
talked a little bit about ice baths before I think in cold exposure

1283
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:31,860
about binary beats and things of those sort.

1284
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:37,680
I think the way to look at any tool to modulate or measure the nervous system

1285
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:43,680
is asked whether or not it's going to move you up or down the state of autonomic arousal

1286
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:47,730
whether or not can make you more alert or more calm, more focused or less focused.

1287
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,730
That's kind of the the two axes here is that we need to think about

1288
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,890
sometimes you want to be more alert than you are and indeed, things like cold showers ice baths

1289
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:00,030
super oxygenation Wim Hof type breathing will bring your level of alertness up.

1290
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,200
There are some cautionary

1291
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,860
notes associated with each of those you need to read and understand those cautionary notes

1292
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,420
for yourself, everybody's different.

1293
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:09,090
And some of those carry certain dangers.

1294
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:13,020
Under certain conditions, others have huge margins for safety.

1295
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,470
And I suppose generally wakes you up. A warm or hot bath generally calms you down

1296
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,480
right by normal beats, there

1297
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:26,130
aren't a lot of data and quality peer reviewed journals I did put in the effort to go search it out

1298
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:29,790
there are a few by neural beats or listening to

1299
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:34,080
frequencies of sound that slightly differ offset for the two years

1300
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:38,820
it has been shown can shift the brain in particular states, you'll notice today

1301
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,790
I didn't really talk about alpha or theta or gamma rhythms.

1302
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:45,060
I, I personally in reviewing the literature

1303
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:50,670
I don't think it's fair to say that alpha states are great for x and theta states are great for why

1304
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,460
And besides, most of us aren't walking around our homes in our workplaces

1305
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,250
geared up to eg machines or with wires down below our skull.

1306
01:21:56,250 --> 01:21:57,630
So we don't know when we're in those states.

1307
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:05,250
Anyway, I think the subjective reading of whether or not one is alert, or calm

1308
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:08,760
and whether or not that alertness or calmness matches the goal

1309
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,490
or the thing that we're trying to achieve in terms of learning

1310
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:18,240
including sleep is the most valuable internal tool in recognition that we can all have.

1311
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,050
In other words, if I want to be very alert, I need to be very alert and I'm exhausted

1312
01:22:22,170 --> 01:22:25,770
there might be tools that I should use to wake up, it might also speak to the fact that I

1313
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,010
might not have slept as as well as I could have or should have the night before.

1314
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:32,490
So it's really about a match between where we are on that

1315
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,670
autonomic arousal scale and what we're trying to achieve.

1316
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,870
And indeed, there are going to be a lot of tools including supplements and other

1317
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,040
prescription drugs and things that can help move us along that autonomic continuum

1318
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:47,010
up toward more alertness or toward more calmness.

1319
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,100
But ultimately, it's about tailoring

1320
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:54,240
that alertness and calmness to the specific types of learning and activities that you

1321
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,830
are going to do and perform.

1322
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,300
And it's reciprocal, meaning some of those activities like exercise

1323
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,080
early in the day will increase your level of autonomic arousal and alertness

1324
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:09,360
certain foods will tend to wake you up certain foods will tend to make you more sleepy

1325
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:12,870
and the volume of food and the timing of food is a factor also.

1326
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,730
So it's a huge parameter space

1327
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:18,870
it's a huge set of variables that impacts whether or not we're feeling well, performing well

1328
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,790
learning great, are not learning great.

1329
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:26,250
And the key thing is to become an observer of your own system and what works for you.

1330
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:27,030
And

1331
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:32,550
to recognize that there are two bins of tools for optimizing learning and brain performance.

1332
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:36,720
One are tools that are really anchored in biological mechanism.

1333
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,220
And we are certain and what those are.

1334
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:38,790
I've

1335
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:42,690
talked about some of those the other the more subjective tools for some of you visualization

1336
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,660
might work terrifically Well, for some of you

1337
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:49,470
one song might really wake you up because of the associations you have with it.

1338
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,190
And for me, I might just, you know, it might repel me from the room

1339
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,260
because I don't like it or it might put me to sleep.

1340
01:23:55,950 --> 01:24:01,170
But of course, volume is kind of a universal loud music tends to wake people up soft music

1341
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:03,150
doesn't tend to wake them up quite as much.

1342
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:08,430
So part of today is really getting you to think about in a scientific way

1343
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:14,130
in a structured way about the non negotiable elements, which are

1344
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,610
that you're going to have a period of every 24 hour cycle when you tend to be more awake

1345
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,580
and appeared when you tend to be more asleep and how to leverage those.

1346
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,940
So you're not fighting an uphill battle to wake up when you actually

1347
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:30,060
would want to be and should be sleeping and not trying to go to sleep when you are

1348
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:32,970
naturally you know, going to be most awake.

1349
01:24:32,970 --> 01:24:36,570
So a lot of it is really anchors back to those core mechanisms of biology

1350
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,590
and then you start layering on the different protocols of food and supplementation, etc.

1351
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:46,740
And I think it's important to recognize that some people are just more go go, go go go and no go.

1352
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:52,800
And some people are just calmer and have a harder time getting into action in an activity

1353
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,360
is just the way that we're wired.

1354
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,180
Some of us have autonomic nervous systems that are more geared towards

1355
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:58,890
parasympathetic calm states.

1356
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:04,470
One of the reasons I Love Bulldogs not just my Bulldog is that they are very calm animals.

1357
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:08,490
In fact, they make no spontaneous movements unless there's something to respond to.

1358
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:12,720
And I find that incredibly relaxing other animals like pitbulls

1359
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,230
who I also really like and enjoy in other species, their tails always wagging.

1360
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:19,800
And that they're always in a position to make a movement at any, any second

1361
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:24,330
because they tend to ride at pretty high levels of autonomic arousal, they pop up really quickly.

1362
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:26,460
When you say it's time to go for a walk.

1363
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:31,650
Costello doesn't one limb at a time, and sometimes he just goes back to sleep.

1364
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,230
And so that there are people like that too.

1365
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:38,430
And so you have to know where you are and what particular goals you're trying to pursue.

1366
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,980
As a final closure to this, I want to emphasize that today.

1367
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:46,770
As always, I've strived to be accurate.

1368
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,150
I'm sure if I made mistakes

1369
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:51,450
some of you will pointed out and I appreciate that and I'll post a correction.

1370
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,100
If we agree that I indeed misspoke, or misguided something.

1371
01:25:57,090 --> 01:25:59,610
But by no means was I exhaustive

1372
01:25:59,910 --> 01:26:03,420
I might have exhausted some of you but the information wasn't exhaustive.

1373
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:07,260
Meaning there's no way that I could cover all the ways in which

1374
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,950
we optimize or can optimize Learning and Performance

1375
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,770
I think we've touched on a number of them that I hope

1376
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:17,190
that you'll find value in and that you'll explore in your own lives.

1377
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,850
We are continuing with this theme because that's what we do.

1378
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:23,550
For this podcast, we stay on one theme for an entire month.

1379
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:30,270
For the next episode, we're going to explore two very essential aspects of neuroplasticity

1380
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:37,200
that actually relate to learning, which are pain, pain management, and neural regeneration.

1381
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:42,150
And for those of you that don't have injuries or don't suffer from chronic pain

1382
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:45,030
the discussion is still going to be a very important one.

1383
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,450
Because it's not just going to be about pain that you're trying to get rid of

1384
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:52,950
it's also going to be about how certain sensory experiences within the pain network

1385
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:57,630
can become amplified, as well as how we can use top down modulation

1386
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:01,350
we can use our mind to suppress the pain response

1387
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,870
we're also going to talk about some of the hardwired mechanisms

1388
01:27:04,170 --> 01:27:08,460
that are bottom up that exist in our periphery in our body to control pain.

1389
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,440
And we're also going to discuss

1390
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:14,730
a number of interesting interactions between the pain system and the learning system.

1391
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:20,760
So again, if you're not interested in pain, per se, it still is going to be a very

1392
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:23,610
valid conversation for sake of understanding

1393
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:27,300
how to optimize brain performance and neural regeneration goes hand in hand

1394
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:28,620
with that discussion.

1395
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,300
So I hope you'll join us for that.

1396
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,230
I suppose I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that

1397
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,350
Costello has been snoring extremely loudly today.

1398
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,220
Yeah, good luck.

1399
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:41,760
Good long walk this morning, which means up the driveway down the driveway.

1400
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:42,690
He's an old dog.

1401
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,660
So if you've been hearing him in the background, and it's been distracting

1402
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:51,150
now you know why it probably relates to where you were on your level of autonomic arousal.

1403
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:54,360
And I'll leave it to you to answer that question for yourself.

1404
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,220
Many of you continue to graciously ask how you can help support the podcast.

1405
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,020
And we really appreciate the question.

1406
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:05,220
The best way is to subscribe wherever it is you happen to be listening or watching.

1407
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:09,000
So for those of you that it's YouTube, please subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1408
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:13,710
It's Apple, subscribe to the podcast on Apple or if it's Spotify, subscribe there

1409
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,060
maybe you subscribe to all three.

1410
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:15,810
If you

1411
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:20,400
have comments and feedback for us suggestions for future podcast episodes or topics to cover

1412
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:24,000
please place those in the comment section on YouTube.

1413
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:27,660
Apple also provides a section where you can give us a rating

1414
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:31,530
we would love it if you give us a five star rating or whatever it is that you feel that we deserve.

1415
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:36,270
And, in general, if you could tell people about the podcast, we

1416
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:39,690
hope that you would tell them because you think the information would be of use to them of course

1417
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:44,730
tell your friends, tell your family, tell your co workers because as we expand the podcast

1418
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,430
the support for the podcast just grows along with it.

1419
01:28:47,490 --> 01:28:49,170
So that's a terrific way to support us.

1420
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,830
As always check out our sponsors, which were mentioned at the beginning.

1421
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:56,310
And in addition to that, we've now set up a Patreon account.

1422
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:00,390
Some of you asked specifically how you can help support the podcast but you weren't interested

1423
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:03,600
in our sponsors, or you were already engaged with our sponsors.

1424
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:09,450
So we have a Patreon account, you can find it@patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1425
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:16,050
Finally, in previous episodes today, and in future episodes, I mentioned supplements.

1426
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,050
Supplements are one way certainly not the only way.

1427
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:25,830
But they're one way in which we can modulate our nervous system for sake of better sleep learning

1428
01:29:26,010 --> 01:29:28,170
alertness and several other things as well.

1429
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:33,510
If you're interested in supplements, we've partnered with Thorne, t h o r n e

1430
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:37,500
because Thorne supplements have very high stringency in terms of

1431
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,930
what's in the bottle the amounts of the substances that are in each capsule or pill, etc.

1432
