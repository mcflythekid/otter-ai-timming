1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:20,970
Ladies and gentlemen, permit me, please, to claim your attention for a moment.

2
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,260
In the words of Winston Churchill, in the Second World War

3
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,870
every bond between man and man was to perish.

4
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,250
Crimes were committed

5
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,600
by the Germans under the Hitlerite domination to which they allowed themselves to be subjected

6
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,180
which find no equal in scale and wickedness with any that have darkened the human record.

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,760
The wholesale massacre by systematize processes of six or seven millions of men

8
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,640
women and children in the German execution camps

9
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,240
exceeds in horror the rough and ready butcheries of Ganga is calm

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,240
and his scale reduces them to pick me proportions.

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,050
Deliberate extermination of whole populations was contemplated

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,170
and pursued by both Germany and Russia in the eastern war.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,680
The hideous process of bombarding open cities from there

14
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,290
once started by the Germans was repaid 20 fold by the ever mounting power of the allies

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,240
and found its culmination in the use of the atomic bombs which obliterated Hiroshima

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,230
and Nagasaki.

32
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,780
It was a simple a noble policy to keep Germany disarmed after the struggle of the First World War

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,240
and the victors sufficiently armed and vigilance.

34
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,500
Pateros was soon made America's failure to enter the League of Nations

35
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,710
the weakness and lack of resolution of Western democracies

36
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,360
to confront the growing strength of the fascist dictators in Germany, Italy and Japan

37
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,260
and the economic turmoil that allowed these events to spark and build.

38
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,790
Upon reflection.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,380
It is all too easy to see and understand how this tragedy could have been avoided.

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,330
But for those in power at the time

41
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,780
they failed all too well to see the Gathering Storm that confronted them.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,280
The origins of the Second World War can be found within the confines of the Palace of Versailles.

43
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,350
Germany surrender in the First World War was a shock to both the international community

44
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,790
as well as to its people.

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,480
Militarily, Germany had been successful on the Eastern Front.

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,110
Troops were deep within France and Germany itself was untouched.

47
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,920
However, on November 11 1918, at 11am, the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,690
a ceasefire came into effect

49
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,740
an armistice had been signed and the war to end all wars had come to an end

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,590
the proud peoples of Germany had been defeated.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,020
The Allies victorious after four years of suffering and untold casualties

52
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,130
wanted to see Germany pay to ensure something like this would never happen again.

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,650
An international institution was to be established

54
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,890
in the hope of bringing about a new world of collective security

55
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,410
latest seen in the form of the League of Nations.

56
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,630
In early 1919.

57
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,430
The Germans were summoned to Versailles

58
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,020
not to negotiate but rather to hear the terms they would have to implement and endure.

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,790
David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Woodrow Wilson of America, George Clemens

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,050
who of France and Orlando of Italy all attended with the aim of weakening Germany

61
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,560
World War One had radically altered the political European map

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,520
with the defeat of the Central Powers including Austria Hungary, Germany

63
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,470
Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire.

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,110
The German state that came out of the Great War

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,460
was also to experience profound change and suffer severe territorial losses.

66
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,430
Germany was to lose a portion of its eastern land, creating

67
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,930
a new Polish state and establishing a Polish corridor between Germany and East Prussia

68
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,970
giving Poland access to the sea.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,890
The port city of Danzig, the largest city on the coast was given to the League of Nations

70
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,290
Mabel in the Baltic was handed over to Lithuania, alsace-lorraine to France and

71
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,180
the mineral riches Ireland was to be administered by the League of Nations for a span of 15 years

72
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,280
with the Rhineland, becoming a demilitarized zone, providing France with additional security.

73
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,720
The German colonies in Africa were distributed to the British and the French

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,630
and their South Pacific colonies would be given to Japan.

75
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,990
In addition, military clauses were added to the treaty.

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,060
The German army could be no larger Than 100,000 troops, they were allowed no air force

77
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,890
no tanks or heavy artillery

78
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,750
and the German Navy could have no more than six warships with no u boats or submarines.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,490
Insults being added to injury, a war guilt clause was placed in the treaty

80
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,120
making Germany accept full responsibility for the outbreak of the war

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,050
as it was only on this basis that the Allies could demand reparations.

82
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,200
France and Britain had begun the war as creditor states

83
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,380
but had ended as debtor nations and wanted to be repaid.

84
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,640
The sums being

85
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,900
asked of Germany and reparations were many times more than was possible for them to pay

86
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,180
place in a severe burden on their economy

87
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,200
which later contributed greatly to economic instability and hyperinflation.

88
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,150
JOHN Maynard Keynes, the primary representative of the British Treasury at the time said

89
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,070
I believe that the campaign for security and out of Germany the general costs of the war

90
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,510
was one of the most serious

91
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,590
acts of political and wisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.

92
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,550
The German people believe that had been bitterly betrayed by their high command

93
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,070
and unjustly treated by the international system

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,120
views that would lead to materialize throughout the 1920s and 30s.

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,740
After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the preceding Great Depression

96
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,580
the world was plunged into economic turmoil and Germany was hit hard.

97
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,650
American banks withdrew the loans they had made to Germany and the economy collapsed overnight

98
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,980
due to such large reductions in cash and capital

99
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,640
bank struggle to provide money and credit and so in 1931

100
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,240
there were runs on German and Austrian banks, with several of them closing

101
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,240
businesses closed at an alarming rate and by 1933, unemployment had reached 6 million.

102
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,070
Many people were left homeless and 1000s of children died from malnutrition

103
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,620
a lack of government resolve

104
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,520
and out of despair many turn to alternative political leaders and parties

105
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,530
in the hope that problems would be solved.

106
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,090
One man in particular garnered a lot of attention from his rousing speeches.

107
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,640
And this man was Adolphe Hitler.

108
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,410
Hitler's speeches delivered clear culprits for Germany's problems.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,520
The November criminals who had signed the armistice end in World War One

110
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,970
the liberals and socialists who had signed the Treaty of Versailles

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,820
the communists who threatened revolution in Germany

112
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,020
and finally the Jewish bankers who plotted to undermine and destroy the German state.

113
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,620
The Nazi and communist parties both clashed violently

114
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,000
and Hitler claimed to be the only one to bring about order and end the red plague.

115
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,960
As a powerful and gifted public speaker, Hitler was able to capitalize on public discontent.

116
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,170
His party, the National Socialist German Workers Party, or the Nazi Party grew to record levels.

117
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,540
In September of 1930, the Nazi Party had increased its representation in the Reichstag

118
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:55,290
the German parliament almost tenfold, winning 107 seats, and only two years later, in 1932

119
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,830
they won 230 seats becoming the majority in parliament.

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,420
Hitler had found the faders and misery of the Great Depression to his advantage.

121
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,840
Stay tuned for harsh reality has opened the eyes of millions of Germans and the 1932 election

122
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,000
Hitler also run for president, and although he lost a decorated war hero Paul von Hindenburg

123
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,330
his rise in popularity gave president Hindenburg no choice

124
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,960
but to appoint Hitler on the 13th of January 1933.

125
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,170
As Chancellor of Germany, head of the German government

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,470
just one month after Hitler had been sworn in as Chancellor

127
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,360
a fire was started in the righteous dag

128
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,160
by a young Dutch communist who was then used to paint all communists as the enemy of Germany.

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,860
Using article 48 of the Constitution.

130
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,900
The Reichstag fire decree was passed

131
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,770
that abolished civil liberties such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

132
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,030
Shortly after Hitler created a secret police known as the Gestapo

133
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,000
helping him to suppress any and all opposition.

134
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,260
As Chancellor.

135
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,360
He also tripled the size of the German military, violating the Treaty of Versailles, banned

136
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,270
all rival parties killed political opponents

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,560
and prohibited Jews from working voting and occupying public spaces.

138
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,830
After the death of President von Hindenburg in 1934, Hitler declared himself fear of Germany

139
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,390
absolute dictator.

140
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,470
Hitler believed the World to Come would be dominated by four main superpowers.

141
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,370
Germany was to be the main hegemonic power of mainland Europe

142
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,980
the British maintaining the international Empire.

143
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,460
The Japanese or the Aaron's of the East has hit the light to call them

144
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,610
would be the main power in Southeast Asia and the Pacific

145
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,520
and finally America would dominate the Western Hemisphere.

146
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,600
Part of Nazi support was their opposition to the Treaty of Versailles.

147
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,160
And upon coming to power Hitler promise to return Germany to its rightful place in the world.

148
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
Hitler's objectives were clear

149
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,940
that our economy needed to be self sufficient on what the Germans called economic autarky.

150
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,990
Being able to produce their own goods and not relying too heavily on imports.

151
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,290
This was critical to withstand the British blockade to trade

152
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,260
a policy that had damaged Germany in the First World War.

153
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,750
Germany would also need Lebensraum

154
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,260
or living space that would facilitate the growing German population.

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Lebensraum was to be found in the east, and this meant Germany would have to expand into Poland

156
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,920
Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and agricultural regions of the Soviet Union.

157
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,780
For Hitler, this new German Reich that was to be created was to be racially pure

158
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,210
containing only the area and race

159
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,870
free of Slavs and Jews of whom would have to leave or be eliminated.

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,700
And it was also Germany's mission to launch a crusade against Judeo Bolshevism

161
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,900
an ideology and enemy that's home took the form of the Soviet Union

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,020
a war he thought would inevitably have to happen.

163
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,150
The international system that had been envisaged was not able to cope.

164
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,950
Without the support of the British

165
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,610
and the United States absence following a policy of non interventionism

166
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,210
France was left alone to maintain and enforce the Treaty of Versailles

167
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,850
something it couldn't and didn't want to do alone.

168
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,400
Held in Geneva, Switzerland

169
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,120
the disarmament conference provided a preview of how Hitler operated

170
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,550
and what future Nazi policy would look like.

171
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,270
Hitler instructed his representatives at the conference

172
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,310
to state that Germany would completely disarm if and only if France, Britain

173
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,530
Japan and the United States would do the same.

174
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,370
This was an offer that Hitler correctly assumed would be denied.

175
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,860
And so he went back to the German people

176
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,620
and showed them how this conference was not about disarmament

177
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,810
but rather keeping Germany subjugated.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,760
And so in 1933, Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference

179
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,200
to the support of his people.

180
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,100
In 1934, to the surprise of the international community

181
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,500
Germany signed a non aggression pact with Poland

182
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,940
taken an ally away from France and weakened in France his military positioning

183
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,010
as Germany was now free to the east.

184
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,560
In March of 1935, Germany revealed it had been building an air force the Luftwaffe

185
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,940
again breaking the Treaty of Versailles, with the justification being that Britain

186
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,290
France and Poland all had an Air Force and that Germany too needed to defend itself.

187
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,580
One week later, Hitler declared his intentions to introduce conscription

188
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,860
to build an army of half a million men.

189
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,060
Once again the League of Nations protested, but no action was taken.

190
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,230
The disarmament clauses outlined in the Treaty of Versailles had been destroyed.

191
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,890
Then, in June of 1935, to France's horror, Britain had entered into a naval agreement with Germany.

192
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,500
The Anglo German naval agreement

193
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,740
in which Britain recognized Germany's right to build up its Navy.

194
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,910
They were to be allowed up to 35% of Britain surface tonnage

195
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,820
and a submarine fleet up to 60% that of Britain's

196
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,840
Britain had struck a deal and in doing so had given up on Versailles

197
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,940
given up on Disarmament and began to show Hitler that a policy of appeasement was to be pursued.

198
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:06,660
A year later, in March 1936, German troops were sent into the demilitarized Rhineland

199
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,620
the matter was referred to the League of Nations, which once again did nothing

200
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,230
remilitarization of the Rhine

201
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,250
was the final nail in the coffin for the Treaty of Versailles and the international order.

202
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,440
The treaty was now officially dead.

203
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,690
France in response to German occupation of the Rhine

204
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,540
constructed imagino line along its eastern border.

205
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,320
However

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,970
the fortification stopped at the Arden forest and did not extend across the Belgium frontier

207
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,580
the place at which Germany had entered during the Great War.

208
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,850
The French were preparing for a war of the trenches and were

209
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,230
not prepared for the motorized divisions that made German blitzkrieg tactics so effective.

210
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,010
Stalin at this time threatened by German power and aggression

211
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,470
entered the Soviet Union into the League of Nations

212
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:57,270
and also signed an agreement with Czechoslovakia, stating he would come to that aid if attacked

213
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,630
but only if the Western Allies would come to its defense burst.

214
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,380
This was to stop the West trying to push German aggression eastwards.

215
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,450
Hitler wanted all German speaking nations in Europe to be unified

216
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,730
especially his native homeland Austria.

217
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,040
Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany and Austria were forbidden to be unified

218
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,320
as the Allies hadn't fought for years to see a large Germany, Austrian President schuschnigg

219
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,600
knowing he would receive no help from Italy

220
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,610
and that France and Britain would not interfere in Hitler's plans resigned, and two days later

221
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,800
German troops marched into Austria unopposed, Hitler had successfully annexed Austria

222
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,280
under the guise of national self determination as justification.

223
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,380
After the successful preoccupation of the Rhineland and the annexation of Austria

224
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,120
Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia

225
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,750
of which 3 million people in this date and land were of German origin.

226
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,040
The Czech government

227
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,240
hope that Britain and France would come to its assistance in the event of a German invasion

228
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,230
but British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was intent on avoiding war

229
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,000
he made two trips to Germany.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,270
In September and offered Hitler favorable agreements

231
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,520
but the fear kept increasing his demands.

232
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,220
On the 30th of September 1938, Hitler attended a meeting in Munich, accompanied by Britain

233
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,390
France and Italy, all of whom agreed that Hitler should have the Sudetenland

234
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,430
as long as he promised to go no further.

235
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,550
The Soviets in the checks were not represented at the meeting

236
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,680
and realizing that no country would come to their

237
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,700
aid Czechoslovakia were forced to surrender the Sudetenland to Germany.

238
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,440
After the meeting

239
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,030
Chamberlain went to him and asked him to sign a peace treaty between Great Britain and Germany

240
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,920
to which Hitler happily agreed.

241
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,930
Upon his return to Britain

242
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,560
Chamberlain delivered his peace in our time speech to cheering crowds.

243
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,130
To people at the time Neville Chamberlain was a great champion.

244
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,400
The Munich Agreement had won the peace and war was averted.

245
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,590
But from this Hitler saw Europe is weak and unwilling to stand up to his demands.

246
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,190
Winston Churchill, one of Chamberlain's greatest critics said

247
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,650
you were given the choice between war and dishonor, you chose to honor a new half war.

248
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,930
Churchill was proven right when just half a year later on the 15th of March 1939

249
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,360
German troops marched into Chekhov's baqia.

250
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:16,230
Once again, Hitler had broken an agreement for France in Britain then guaranteed Poland safety

251
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,560
with

252
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,660
Britain also beginning to rearm and install a highly secret radar system along its east coast.

253
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,390
On August 23 1939, the Germans and the Soviet signed a non aggression pact

254
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,420
which sent shockwaves across the world's diplomatic community.

255
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,950
The signing of this pact for Hitler ended the prospect of a two front war

256
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,080
which allowed for a greater taking of Poland.

257
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,030
But for starlin this bought him time to rebuild the Red Army that he had purged.

258
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,070
As the Last Days of Summer arrived, there was a sense in Europe that war was imminent

259
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,570
and the sense was right.

260
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,550
Blitzkrieg or lightning war revolutionized warfare

261
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,330
and allowed an attacker to destroy an opponent before they were even mobilized.

262
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,850
Through the use of tanks or Panzers

263
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,500
German forces were able to quickly smash border defenses and circle enemy troops.

264
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,080
They were to be supported by tactical airpower

265
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,100
the Luftwaffe that provided close aerial support to ground operations.

266
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,030
Using this tactic, Germany was able to quickly knock out opponents

267
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,340
allowing them to conduct operations without the total mobilization of the economy and society

268
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,650
much like the First World War had required.

269
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,840
The First World War was one of attrition

270
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:31,020
something Germany wasn't in the current position to win or endure.

271
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,310
This new mode of warfare therefore, was to be one of speed and efficiency.

272
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:47,880
On September 1 1939, Germany with 52 divisions, and over 1 million men made their way into Poland

273
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,690
attacking through the north in the south, destroying the Polish armed forces.

274
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,700
Britain responded with an ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations.

275
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,820
The ultimatum was ignored, and so France, Britain

276
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,700
Australia and New Zealand all declared war on Germany

277
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,670
with Neville Chamberlain broadcasting the announcement on radio.

278
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,920
The German attack was led by five armored divisions containing 300 tanks apiece

279
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,360
followed by four motorized infantry divisions carrying their artillery and equipment

280
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,820
with cover provided from the air by the Luftwaffe.

281
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,230
Believing that the invasion would be stopped by British and French intervention

282
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,580
the Polish was slow to mobilize and poorly prepared to face the German onslaught.

283
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,810
Upon mobilization, the poll sported 1.3 million men

284
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,140
however, possessed outdated equipment and only a few tanks

285
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,910
with the German armored and motorized divisions out number in the Polish 15 to one.

286
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,420
Equipment were so scarce and outdated for the polish

287
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,070
that cavalry squadrons were seen to be charging heavily armored German tank divisions.

288
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,760
The invasion had worked with greater speed and efficiency than planned

289
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,420
and by September 8 Warsaw, the Polish capital had been reached.

290
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,220
Once Germany had broken Polish resistance, Stalin move troops into Poland

291
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,530
being keen to regained territory that had once belonged to Russia before the 1917 revolution.

292
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,640
Poland was now to fight a war on two fronts, something they get couldn't win

293
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,250
and so on the 27th of September 1939, Polish command has negotiated a ceasefire

294
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,640
with the last Polish military unit surrendering on October 6.

295
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,260
Altogether, Poland lost 70,000 troops against the German invaders

296
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,630
and another 50,000 against the USSR with 133,000 been wounded.

297
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,230
The Germans took over 700,000 Polish prisoners

298
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,780
and the Soviets another 300,000 150,000 poles managed to escape

299
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:39,990
many coming to Great Britain and enlisting in the armed forces.

300
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,420
For Hitler, the invasion of Poland was his third successful annexation of a foreign country.

301
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,380
He had got what he wanted, and the Western powers had once again nothing.

302
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,780
This period became known as the phoney war because Britain and France took no military action.

303
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,700
Despite declaring war on Germany.

304
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,050
Blitzkrieg had been a major success and over the course of The next few months

305
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,140
Hitler continuously said that he didn't want to war in the West.

306
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,710
Three months after the invasion of Poland

307
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,040
Stalin was afraid that Finland would fall under German influence

308
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,250
as Leningrad was only 20 miles away from the finish border.

309
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,990
The Soviets demanded the Finns succeed territory on the karelian estimates

310
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,940
as to put Leningrad out of danger.

311
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:33,150
The Finns refused, and so the Soviet Union launched military action on the 30th of November 1939.

312
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:39,390
The Soviet Army outnumbered the Finns 50 to one and equipment out match them in almost every way.

313
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,850
But the Finns fought with great tenacity

314
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,320
were in white uniforms as to blend into the snow and outmaneuver in the Red Army.

315
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,540
Finland resisted Soviet attacks for more than two months and inflicted considerable damage.

316
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,580
After the Soviet military reorganized itself and adopted different tactics

317
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,750
they continued their offensive in February overcoming finished defenses.

318
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,880
The war came to an end in March 1940, with the signing of the Moscow peace treaty

319
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,780
with Finland surrendering 11% of its territory to the Soviet Union.

320
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,780
The dreadful performance of the Red Army and Finland

321
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:17,130
encouraged Hitler to think that an attack on the Soviet Union would be successful, and

322
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,660
confirmed to the Western powers that the Soviet military was not the best equipped or organized

323
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,810
something that wouldn't be fully tested for another 15 months

324
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,210
with the German launch of Operation Barbarossa.

325
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,260
In April of 1940, Adolf Hitler made a huge strategic gamble.

326
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,610
His plan was to send the whole strength of the German Navy along the Norwegian coast

327
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,850
from Oslo to Novick to protect the coastal waterways.

328
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,110
Swedish iron ore could then be safely transported to German blast furnaces

329
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,820
and German control of Norwegian waters would make an allied blockade of Germany a lot harder.

330
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,550
British discontent over the Norwegian campaign

331
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,560
and an allied withdrawal led to the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on the 10th of may 1940.

332
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,350
His successor was appointed the same day

333
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,150
a man who throughout the 1930s had spoken out regarding German rearmament

334
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,740
and Hitler's threat to the world.

335
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:23,160
A man who went by the name of Winston Churchill on the 10th of may 1940

336
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,720
Germany launches an attack against France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

337
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,590
French troops quickly positioned themselves along the Maginot Line, and the

338
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,940
rest of the Allied soldiers positioned themselves along the Belgium and Luxembourg borders.

339
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,160
As Belgium is neutral

340
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,550
Allied soldiers could not enter the country and prepare a defensive position

341
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,100
and so we'd have to wait for Germany to invade.

342
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,590
Germany began their offensive in the early hours of the morning with more than 1000 fighters

343
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,030
bombers and dive bombers.

344
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,690
They attacked

345
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,070
allied airfields destroying the Air Force on the ground before they could even take flight

346
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,770
something that would be crucial in giving the Luftwaffe an

347
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,080
air superiority for the rest of the offensive.

348
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,540
Just three hours after being attacked Belgium permits Allied troops to enter the country

349
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,220
due to the great mobility of German Panzers and motorized infantry divisions

350
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,760
that allied forces never had the time to establish a practical defense

351
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:21,180
and within the day luxembourgers captured sporty nearly two and a half million men

352
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,580
the German invasion worked with greater efficiency.

353
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,430
Three army groups were to be used for the invasion, Army Group A, B and C.

354
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,690
Army Group B was tasked with defeating the Netherlands

355
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,020
and then advancing into Belgium to keep the Allied forces in place.

356
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,210
Army Group C were to attack through the Maginot Line keeping those soldiers in place

357
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,460
and protecting the flank of Army Group A

358
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:49,680
comprising of 750,000 troops Army Group A was by far the largest.

359
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,000
They were to push through the Arden forest and naturally fortified area

360
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,210
something the French were not expecting to be entered or breached.

361
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:01,830
41,000 vehicles successfully made their way through the southern forest.

362
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,090
The Germans then crossed the Meuse river and by May 15 capture sedan.

363
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,610
They then head west katene

364
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,300
often surrounding the entire allied army that had advanced into Belgium.

365
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,250
This unexpected push through the odd den would force Allied soldiers out of Belgium

366
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,790
with them having to withdraw to the port of Dunkirk to protect their flank.

367
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,970
With the Allies completely surrounded by German forces, Winston Churchill

368
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,350
launches are planned to evacuate the British Expeditionary Force from Northern France.

369
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,290
400,000 Allied troops are stranded on the beaches of Dunkirk, and on May 26

370
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,440
Operation Dynamo begins by air

371
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,060
the Luftwaffe are constantly attack the soldier stranded on the beaches and sink many ships

372
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,000
and by land German artillery fires upon the shore.

373
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,580
The Royal Air Force in response launches a counter attack to protect the ships and soldiers.

374
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,970
The beaches at Dunkirk are shallow and even at a high tide.

375
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,910
Destroyers can approach within a mile of the shore

376
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,150
and so the troops would have to be ferried out in small craft.

377
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,930
On the 31st of may hundreds of civilian vessels

378
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,130
known as Little ships make their way across the English Channel to evacuate the soldiers

379
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,610
fishing boats, lifeboats, sailing barges

380
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,240
ferries and supply ships will do their part in bringing the soldiers home.

381
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,780
The British Expeditionary Force had survived

382
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,200
but almost all of the heavy artillery in equipment was left behind.

383
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,130
By the fourth of June 1940 338,000 troops had been evacuated, making the events at Dunkirk

384
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,280
a miracle and the largest evacuation in military history.

385
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,090
The surrender of France followed some Three weeks later

386
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,740
after Mussolini declared war on France and German troops marched into Paris

387
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,240
ceilin France his fate.

388
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,450
In just six weeks from the 10th of may 1940, German forces conquered France, Belgium

389
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,040
Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

390
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,510
By the end of June

391
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,860
Hitler dominated the European continent with victory on a scale never seen before.

392
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,370
What Germany hadn't accomplished in four years in the Great War

393
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,030
had taken Hitler just 35 days which is later become known

394
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,120
as one of the most remarkable military campaigns in history.

395
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,180
The future of the free world hung in the balance.

396
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:24,630
Britain faced a perilous situation after the fall of France

397
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,590
and all that separated the Germans from yet another victory was the English Channel.

398
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,130
The isolationist United States was an ocean away

399
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,240
which left only one man to make a decision that would change the course of human history.

400
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,980
With the fighting over

401
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,940
Germany began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain.

402
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,440
It's our hope that Churchill would come to his senses and sign a peace treaty.

403
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:50,250
But if the British refused, Hitler's only option was to invade.

404
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,330
Churchill then delivered his We will fight on the beaches speech.

405
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,590
This famous speech transformed Churchill into a world statesman

406
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:01,860
outlining unequivocally he would never make peace with Hitler.

407
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,110
But war was now to come.

408
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,290
Germany had to plan an invasion of Great Britain

409
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,920
the invasion of France and Poland had taken months to plan

410
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,830
with every intricate detail of battle thought through

411
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,110
but the invasion of Britain with orders from high command would have to be ready by August 15.

412
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:29,820
Giving them just one month the British began to dig in.

413
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,030
Coastal defences were constructed across southern England

414
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,270
signposts were removed and replaced to confuse invaders.

415
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,080
Fields were laced with barbed wire to deter airborne troops

416
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,700
and a Home Guard was established full of those who are illegible or too old to fight.

417
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,920
Meanwhile, Hitler began his plan for the invasion of the British Isles

418
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,020
codenamed Operation sea line.

419
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,420
20 divisions were to be deployed in Britain south coast to the use of amphibious landing craft.

420
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,420
However, the English Channel wasn't easy to cross

421
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,620
the Royal Navy was still the largest in the world and despite Empire commitments

422
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,220
Britain's home fleet of ships still far out numbered the German Navy.

423
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,490
The German naval chief Admiral Eric Rader

424
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,930
didn't believe he could seize the English Channel for long enough to get the German army across

425
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,970
for a successful invasion of Britain.

426
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,450
Therefore, Germany would first have to gain control of the sky.

427
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,010
The Luftwaffe are far outnumbered the Royal Air Force in June of 1940

428
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:32,040
the British had less than 700 operational fighters against 2600 German fighters and bombers.

429
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,570
The odds were daunting.

430
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,050
Both sides sported some of the most advanced planes of the time

431
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,710
the British with their supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane

432
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,750
which shot down the most German planes.

433
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,140
These were up against the German Messerschmitt Bf 109.

434
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,110
And these were to be used to escorts German bombers

435
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,820
for use of radar was crucial to the British during the Battle of Britain

436
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,060
and was the world's first integrated air defense system.

437
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,120
Placed along the south and east coast of Britain.

438
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:06,450
These tool masks could pick up aircraft at a range of 120 miles, given their distance, direction

439
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,770
height and numbers.

440
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:11,190
This information would then be sent to our air Fighter Command

441
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:16,830
run by Air Chief Marshal whew doubt in and the closest RF airfields would then be alerted.

442
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,320
On the 10th of July 1940

443
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:22,830
the Luftwaffe were began to attack ship in traveling across the English Channel

444
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,810
but this was not their main aim.

445
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,280
General Garin

446
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:31,230
head of the German Air Force focused the German assault on destroying the RF in the sky

447
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,500
there airfields and aircraft production factories.

448
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,460
When the initial assault was launched, airfields were heavily bombed

449
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,230
but none had been put out of action.

450
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,170
British radar gave them plenty of warning and

451
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,670
were able to shoot down the enemy planes in nominal scene dogfights that would consume the sky.

452
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,570
The Luftwaffe had lost 46 aircraft to just 12 British.

453
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:56,790
Two days later, Goering launched the largest Attack of the whole battle on August 15.

454
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,910
Waves of German bombers destroyed British airfields.

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,770
42 British fighters had been destroyed at the cost of 90 German aircraft.

456
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,410
Over the next 12 days guerin's plan continued, and fighters on both sides were suffering.

457
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,630
The Royal Air Force were exhausted

458
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,710
and the German fighters were demoralized as the British seem to always be waiting for them.

459
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,010
But British losses soon began to rapidly increase.

460
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,050
Many men died and planes in airfields were being destroyed at an alarming rate.

461
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,190
If the battle continued along these lines, a German victory would be imminent.

462
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,940
Goering realizing this began to attack at night as well.

463
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,670
However, a major mistake was about to occur.

464
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,620
On the cloudy night of August 24, a group of German bombers lost their way

465
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,720
and accidentally bombed the City of London.

466
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,700
The following night 81 British bombers made their way to Berlin in retaliation

467
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,180
an act that showed Britain could attack as well as defend.

468
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,110
Hitler was furious and began a campaign of bombing London.

469
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,670
On the seventh of September

470
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,730
German bombers attacked London's East End 450 people died and 1000s of homes were destroyed.

471
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,830
But this was a crucial mistake by focusing on London rather than the airfields

472
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:13,020
RF bases were relieved of pressure and had the time to repair and rebuild aircraft.

473
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,270
One week later, on the 15th of September on what became known as the Battle of Britain day

474
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,320
the Luftwaffe embarked on an all out attack against London, which they

475
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,790
believe would break fighter commands resistance and pave the way for a successful invasion.

476
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,990
The ra f successfully fought the incoming wave of lift warfare formations

477
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,970
destroying 61 aircraft the highest losses the Luftwaffe had suffered for over a month

478
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,850
with the RF only losing 31 aircraft.

479
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:44,070
The 15th of September can be seen as an overwhelming and decisive defeat for the Luftwaffe.

480
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,050
They had failed to gain air superiority over Great Britain and on September 17

481
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,890
just two days later, Hitler postponed operation sea lion.

482
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,200
With the help of foreign pilots, especially those of Poland, France and Czechoslovakia

483
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,830
the Royal Air Force were able to repel a Nazi invasion.

484
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,090
To show his appreciation to all those who fought Churchill said the following.

485
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:13,650
Never in the field of human country was so much owed by so many can cope.

486
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,460
With the invasion of Britain no longer possible.

487
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,530
Hitler turned his attention eastwards

488
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,090
Germany was now to focus on the largest military operation in human history

489
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,230
Operation Barbarossa the invasion of the Soviet Union.

490
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,160
The fighting was not over.

491
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,680
However, the Blitz had now begun.

492
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,410
British cities were bombed and night raids

493
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,430
and London was attacked every night for 57 consecutive nights by one and on November 10 1940

494
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,270
a 14th Century Gothic cathedral in Coventry was obliterated.

495
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,840
Children were evacuated to the countryside

496
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:01,590
and people living in London spent most nights sleeping in air raid shelters

497
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,240
are in the London Underground.

498
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:07,020
A blackout was enforced after darkness where all sources of light

499
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,730
had to be covered up as to prevent the Germans from seeing where towns and homes were located.

500
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,990
Over the course of the Blitz, which lasted eight months and five days

501
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,600
just under 2 million homes were destroyed

502
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,400
and 40,000 civilians were killed with 87,000 been seriously injured.

503
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,290
But most importantly, the bombing had failed to demoralize the British into surrender.

504
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,910
The full force of the German war machine was now to be turned against the Soviet Union.

505
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:43,500
This war was to be won to the death, a clash of two ideologies

506
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,520
two forces of civilization in which only one could be victorious.

507
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,960
Hitler hated communism, and victory over the Soviet Union

508
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,990
would provide Germany with the abundant natural resources

509
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,680
that would enable the German people to finally become the master race.

510
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,490
Operation Barbarossa was Hitler's greatest gamble.

511
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,440
Unable to defeat Great Britain in the West, Germany's armies were deployed to the east.

512
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,160
Luckily for Hitler, the Red Army, the largest in the world had been

513
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:17,550
devastated by Stalin's purges during the 1930s 10s of 1000s of officers were shot or imprisoned

514
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,030
an inefficiency and a lack of coordination became widespread.

515
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,840
Before the invasion began and to secure Germany's southern flank on April 6 1941

516
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,730
Germany invaded the Balkans.

517
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,140
33 divisions entered Yugoslavia and six days later they surrendered.

518
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,590
Greece then fell and Athens was captured within three weeks

519
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,650
Operation Barbarossa could now commence.

520
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,900
Over 4 million men were to be deployed accompanied by over 3000 aircraft.

521
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:50,070
Three divisions were also to be used much like the invasion of France.

522
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,360
Army Group North would push through the Baltic states and C's Leningrad

523
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,970
Army Group Center was too advanced to Moscow and Army Group South would occupy the Ukraine

524
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,370
The Red Army was far larger

525
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,540
they had 2 million men along the western front and millions more in reserve.

526
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,320
They also sported 20,000 tanks against Germany 6000 although they were older and less advanced

527
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,540
Germany versus the Soviet Union

528
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,310
would therefore be a war between superior technology and speed versus sheer numbers.

529
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:26,010
On June 22 1941, the operation began at 3:15am.

530
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,660
The Luftwaffe attacked Soviet airfields while the ground invasion commenced.

531
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,120
Hitler's Panzers then pushed forward and within two days had penetrated more than 50 miles.

532
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:41,130
The Red Army was no match and 10s of 1000s of Soviet prisoners were rounded up.

533
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,060
As July came blitzkrieg was successful as ever.

534
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:50,490
Within a week, the Panzers were at Smolensk only a few 100 miles away from Moscow.

535
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,830
It was here that the tanks would rest

536
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,940
so the rest of the army that often relied on horse drawn carriages could catch up.

537
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:02,070
Prisoners that had been captured along the way, also began heading west to captivity

538
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,190
in which two and a half million men would never return.

539
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,780
Meanwhile, the German advanced in the south was having troubles

540
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:14,760
and so Hitler ordered Army Group north to swing south to Kiev to provide help

541
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,160
to which his generals heavily objected.

542
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,890
It would turn out to be a disastrous decision.

543
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,740
Soviet manpower seem to be endless

544
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,540
and the whole turret Smolensk allowed Starling to mobilize more than 16 million troops

545
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,810
and a new Soviet tank was headed towards the frontline.

546
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,370
The T 34

547
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,460
which was faster than the Panzer mark for the remnants of Army Group North surrounded Leningrad

548
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,410
modern day St Petersburg.

549
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,430
But rather than capturing the city, the Germans decided to starve it.

550
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,330
Starvation began and more than 11,000 people died in November

551
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,410
and another 3700 on one day in December alone.

552
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,610
The Siege lasted for more than two years, and by the end in 1944

553
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,710
over a million Soviets had been killed.

554
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:05,520
Army Group Center now prepared for an offensive on Moscow, and on the 25th of September 1941

555
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,380
they began their assault, the panss advanced and even more Soviet troops were captured

556
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,710
but Stalin was determined to defend Moscow to the last.

557
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:19,350
On October 8, bad weather halted the German advance and they were still 50 miles from Moscow.

558
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,680
Hitler would now pay the price for sending troops South

559
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,530
rather than advancing on Moscow earlier on in the year.

560
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,360
Speed that gave German blitzkrieg tactics the advantage was now obsolete.

561
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,310
The Soviet winter arrived.

562
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,760
German forces thinking the campaign would be over by summer.

563
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,990
What underprepared tank engines would not start, weapons froze

564
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,760
and soldiers were frostbitten as they didn't have the proper clothing, and on December 5

565
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,440
Germany halted its attack.

566
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,680
Stalin then moved his armies from Siberia to the west, more than 30 divisions made their way

567
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,770
who were all well equipped and trained for fighting in the winter.

568
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,150
By December, more than half a million extra men were in place.

569
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,420
With additional support, the Soviets began a counter attack

570
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,000
driving German forces back for the next seven days Soviet troops tore into German forces.

571
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,790
Hitler ordered for there to be no more retreats

572
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,780
he told his forces they should fight and if necessary, die where they stood

573
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,000
the German line held strong.

574
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,250
For the next four months

575
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,680
the two sides fought and Hitler hadn't got the quick results that he'd wanted or planned, hated.

576
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,020
His army then moved south in search for oil, and began a campaign of securing Stalingrad

577
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,710
and so began one of the longest battles of the Second World War

578
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,840
the city had to be taken streets by street, house by house and room by room.

579
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,250
But the Soviet two began to move troops and equipment southwards

580
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:49,950
more than a million men 900 tanks and more than 1000 aircraft removed to the battle zone

581
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,720
and attack the German flank.

582
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,020
It was now the Germans who surrendered in the 1000s.

583
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,230
Over 100,000 men made their way to captivity, with only 5000, eventually returning to Germany

584
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,900
Germany lost 300,000 men in the Battle of Stalingrad and the Soviets around the same numbers

585
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,300
but the tide of the battle had begun to turn.

586
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,420
The Soviet Army continued its success.

587
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,780
German troops began to withdraw to protect their flank

588
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,350
and the Soviet winter offensive saw them gain lots of territory.

589
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,520
Over the course of a few months, Germany had lost over a million men.

590
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:28,350
The Soviet Army mobilized further and drove back the German lines at Kursk

591
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,280
never again with the German war machine launch and offensive in the east.

592
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,120
Across the globe on the 26th of November 1941

593
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,630
a Japanese carrier fleet set sail in the northern Pacific, its target was a US naval base in Hawaii

594
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,270
which went by the name of Pearl Harbor.

595
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,990
What had been confined to remain the European war

596
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:56,700
was now to be transformed into the deadliest global conflict in human history.
