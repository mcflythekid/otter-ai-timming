00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Welcome to the human lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,790
where we discuss science and science based tools for everyday life.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,800
My name is Andrew Huberman,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,390
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,140
This podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,540
It is, however part of my desire and effort

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,690
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,330
and science related tools to the general public.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,950
In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,500
Our first sponsor is insidetracker.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,620
Insidetracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

12
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,950
to help you better understand your body and inform your health goals.

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,650
I'm a big believer in getting blood test taken,

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,980
because it's simply the only way to get in depth data about your metabolic factors, hormones,

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,160
all the things that inform your immediate and long term health.

16
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,220
Nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,790
that can further inform you about your immediate and long term health.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,520
Now, the problem with most blood tests out there

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,160
is that you get information back you get a lot of numbers,

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,790
and they'll tell you whether or not your numbers are normal range or high or low,

21
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,820
but they don't inform you what steps to take as a consequence.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,290
In addition, they can often be very confusing what all the factors are and what they really mean.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,770
Insidetracker has a dashboard and a platform that makes

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,200
interpreting all that information really easy.

25
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,330
It also points you in the direction of certain lifestyle factors, exercise, nutrition, etc,

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,350
that you might want to change in order to bring the numbers into the ranges that you want.

27
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,650
So insidetracker is something that I've been doing for some time now.

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,810
And it's really helped me inform the choices.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,930
For instance, I've swapped out some of the foods that I was eating regularly,

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,520
I found out I was actually too high in certain vitamins and minerals, I was too low and others,

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,540
it's really helped me adjust my diet and my exercise regimes.

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,050
And it really gives me the confidence that I'm on the path to long term health.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,970
So if you want to try inside tracker,

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:03,390
you can go to inside tracker comm slash Huberman to get 25% off any of inside trackers plans,

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,160

36
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,230
to get 25% off any of insidetracker his plans and use the code Huberman at checkout.

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,960
Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,930
Express VPN is a virtual private network that keeps your data safe and secure and private.

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,500
It does that by routing your internet activity through their servers,

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,620
and encrypting it so that no one can see or sell your data.

41
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,210
I started using ExpressVPN, because my bank account got hacked.

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,040
I still don't know exactly how it happened.

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,690
But it was an absolute mess.

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,430
I lost money, I lost a lot of time, I wouldn't want to have it happen to anybody.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,670
When that happened, I talked to my friends in the tech community.

46
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,200
And they told me that even though you think your internet connection is secure, oftentimes,

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,800
it's not.

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,740
So I tend to use internet connections on planes, in hotels, in cafes, but also at home.

49
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,000
And I was told that even at home, your data may not be as secure as you think.

50
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,660
And so with ExpressVPN, your data is absolutely secure.

51
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,280
So your online activities.

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,080
The great thing is, you don't even notice that it's operating, it's running in the background,

53
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,280
you just turn it on, and it goes without you realizing that your data is being protected.

54
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,890
It doesn't interfere with any of your online activities.

55
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,200
So I use Express VPN when I travel anytime I'm outside the house when I'm at work,

56
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,370
and when I'm at home.

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,300
If you want to try Express VPN, you can go to express VPN comm slash Huberman and if you do that,

58
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,470
you'll get an extra three months free on one of their one year packages.

59
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,320
That's Express VPN comm slash ubermann to get three months free on a one year package.

60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,010
The final sponsor of today's podcast is magic spoon.

61
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,300
Magic spoon is a zero sugar grain free keto friendly cereal.

62
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,050
As I've mentioned before on the podcast, I'm neither ketogenic nor my all meat nor am I vegan.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,090
The way I eat is that early in the day I fast and then sometime around noon, I eat my first meal,

64
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,640
and that meal is always low carbohydrate.

65
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,090
And then throughout the day, I maintain a low carbohydrate diet,

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,730
the fasting and low carbohydrate diet during the daytime optimizes alertness and wakefulness,

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,620
I want to be awake and be able to work

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,820
and then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates because it facilitates the transition to sleep.

69
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,820
So for me, magic spoon is a terrific snack in the afternoon, or sometimes even have it with lunch.

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,620
And the reason I like it is because it tastes really delicious and it's compatible with the

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,970
keto friendly or you know, keto like meals that I eat throughout the day.

72
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,500
They come in a variety of flavors, cocoa fruity peanut butter frosted,

73
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,540
I particularly like the frosted because it tastes like donuts In my opinion, and I love donuts.

74
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,650
As a consequence, I love magic spoon cereal, I can consume it.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,810
It tastes like a pastry and it has

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,670
zero grams of sugar and it's compatible with this nutritional regimen I mentioned earlier.

77
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,760
If you want to try magic spoon you can go to magic spoon comm slash Huberman to grab a variety pack

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,140
Use the code Huberman at checkout and get $5 off your order.

79
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,420
That's magic spoon comm slash Huberman and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

80
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,480
This month, we're talking all about the science of emotions,

81
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,210
and tools related to the science of emotions.

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,280
We've talked about the science of stress and resiliency tools to access more calm

83
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,880
tools to raise your stress threshold to become more resilient.

84
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,940
We've talked about motivation and the role of the dopamine system,

85
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,690
I'd like to make a couple of announcements about some new resources.

86
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,010
The first one is

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:37,560
that we have now captioned all the Huberman lab episodes in English and in Spanish,

88
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,730
we were able to do that thanks to your support of our sponsors, and on Patreon.

89
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,440
So now, all of the podcasts have a captioning feature on YouTube.

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,810
And those were done by experts.

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,790
So while there might be the occasional error, for the most part, they're very precise.

92
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,080
We've done that so that people that prefer to consume the content in Spanish,

93
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:02,250
or that like to read the content from the English subtitles can do so.

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,310
And we're going to continue to expand the number of languages that are

95
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,910
captioned for the Huberman lab podcast, so we want to thank you for that resource.

96
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,250
It's now available for all episodes.

97
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,820
In addition, in previous episodes I've talked about an SDR are non sleep depressed,

98
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,240
and SDRs come in in a variety of different forms.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,690
There's self hypnosis, I pointed you to some resources for that previously, there's Yoga nidra.

100
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,680
And SDR is really about achieving calm quickly.

101
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,990
And doing that in a self directed way.

102
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:39,450
For many reasons, in order to access sleep more readily, in order to de stress very deeply,

103
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,330
in order to replace sleep that you've lost.

104
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,530
It also seems to aid neural plasticity, it can enhance the

105
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,870
rearrangements of connections in the brain

106
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
that occurred during learning their scientific support for that.

107
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,730
There's a link in today's episode caption to a new site.

108
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,750
This is a YouTube video that was brought free of cost

109
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,980
by the folks over it made for a company that's been a sponsor of the podcast previously.

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,370
So this is an SDR script that doesn't contain any of the intentions,

111
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,860
or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra.

112
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,010
Instead, it's focused purely on the breathing protocols, as well as includes a sort of body scan,

113
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,980
redirect your attention to different locations around your body.

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,010
It has all the core elements of non sleep deep rest, but is distinct from Yoga nidra,

115
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,780
I just offer this to you as a resource, if you'd like to use it, it's about 30 minutes long,

116
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,290
and should be very effective in bringing you into deep states of relaxation

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,970
for all the reasons I mentioned before.

118
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,580
So let's talk about emotions.

119
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,840
Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect of our life experience.

120
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,510
It's fair to say that emotions make up most of what we think of as our experience of life,

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,260
even the things we do our behaviors and the places we go,

122
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,660
and the people we end up encountering in our life.

123
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,990
All of that really funnels into our emotional perception of what those things mean,

124
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,230
whether or not they made us happy, or sad, or depressed or lonely, or were all inspiring.

125
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,670
Now, one thing that is

126
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,900
absolutely true is that everyone's perception of emotion is slightly different.

127
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:23,460
Meaning, your idea of happy is very likely different than my idea of what a state of happiness is.

128
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,540
And we know this also, for color vision, for instance,

129
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,340
even though the cells in your eye and my eye that perceive the color red,

130
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,700
are identical right down to the genes that they express.

131
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:42,420
We can be certain based on experimental evidence, what are called psychophysical studies, that

132
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,150
your idea of the most intense red is going to be very different than my idea of the most

133
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,650
intense red if we were given a selection of 10 different reds and asked which one is most intense,

134
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,630
which one looks most red.

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,310
And that seems crazy.

136
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,720
You would think that something as simple as color would be universal, and yet it's not.

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:07,440
And so we need to agree at the outset, that emotions are complicated, and yet they are tractable,

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
they can be understood.

139
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,620
And today we're going to talk about a lot of tools to understand what emotions are

140
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,850
for you to understand what your emotional states mean, and what they don't mean.

141
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:18,960
And in doing that,

142
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,540
that will allow you to place a value on whether or not you should hold an emotional state as true

143
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,870
or not true whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't,

144
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,400
as well as whether or not the emotions of others are important to you in a given context.

145
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,370
We're going to talk a lot about development.

146
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,690
In fact, we're going to center a lot of our discussion today around infancy and puberty.

147
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,980
We're also going to talk about tools for enhancing one's emotional range

148
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,360
and for navigating difficult emotional situations.

149
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,610
I am not a clinical psychologist, I'm not a therapist, but I do have some background in psychology.

150
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,600
And today I'm going to be drawing from the psychology greats.

151
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,970
Not me but from the Great's of psychology.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,940
Who studied emotion who studied emotional development,

153
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,710
and the linking that to the neuroscience of emotion, because nowadays, we understand a lot

154
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,520
about the chemicals and the hormones and the neural circuits in the brain and body

155
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,050
that underlie emotion.

156
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,310
So while there's no one single universally true theory of emotion,

157
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,930
at the intersection of many of the existing theories, there really some ground truth.

158
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,030
So today, we're going to visit those ground truths.

159
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,130
We're going to talk about the tools that emerged from them.

160
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,450
And we're going to talk about some

161
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,010
absolutely wild and wacky experiments that people are doing out there right now that I don't

162
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:32,970
necessarily recommend

163
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,230
you do of inhaling different types of hormones and trying to get attached more quickly,

164
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,170
you're actually going to do some experiential stuff today, if you like.

165
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,370
There's some things that you can do in real time, while listening to the podcast,

166
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,180
in order to tap into some of the mechanisms that I'll be referring to.

167
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,140
So today's can be very interactive in a way that previous podcast episodes have not.

168
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,450
If we want to understand emotions, we have to look at where emotions first develop.

169
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,150
In fact, this is a critical central theme.

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,430
If you want to understand brain science and psychology, there's a rule in neuroanatomy.

171
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,940
Because if you look at 50 Different Brains of humans, or you compare the brains of dogs and humans,

172
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,290
there are a lot of differences.

173
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,510
Certain things are the same, but certain things are different.

174
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,610
And the rule that every good,

175
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,050
neuroanatomist knows is that if you want to understand what a part of the brain does,

176
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,880
you have to address two questions.

177
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,630
First, you have to know what connections does that brain area make?

178
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,610
What is it connected to?

179
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,170
Where does it get inputs from?

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,450
And where does it send inputs.

181
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,120
So for instance, if there's an area of the brain that gets direct input from the neurons in the nose,

182
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,240
you can be pretty certain that it has some role in analyzing smell in measuring

183
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,300
something about odors, or analyzing something about odors.

184
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,550
Now, if it also gets input from the eye,

185
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,200
you can also conclude that it gets input from the visual system that it cares about

186
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,170
light and photons, this is sort of obvious.

187
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,270
And yet, you need to know that connectivity.

188
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,610
And you need to know what's called the developmental origin of that structure,

189
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,280
you need to know where it was early in development.

190
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,480
Because things move around a lot as the brain develops, the brain, of course,

191
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,430
is this more or less squishy thing

192
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,670
floating around in some liquid that stuffed inside your skull.

193
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,130
And as a consequence, things move around a lot,

194
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,580
they are not always in the same place in two different species,

195
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,310
or to individuals of the same species.

196
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,470
So you have to know where they started out,

197
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,320
because where they started out informs what they do as well.

198
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,060
And when we're talking about emotions, we cannot point to one area of the brain,

199
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,720
we can't say that's the area of the brain that's responsible for emotions.

200
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,600
There is this so called limbic system that has been linked to emotions in various ways.

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,070
We're going to talk about that today.

202
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,410
But the limbic system is just one component of the inputs to create emotions.

203
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:57,660
It's not the place for emotions, you can't go in and lesion one location in the brain

204
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,470
and eliminate emotions entirely just doesn't work that way.

205
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,200
So, first of all, we have to ask, what are the circuits for emotion?

206
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
What are the brain areas for emotion and nowadays, there's a lot of debate about this.

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,100
For years, there was thought that there might be circuits,

208
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,250
meaning connections in the brain that generate the feeling of being happy,

209
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,250
or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, etc.

210
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,350
That's been challenged.

211
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:27,270
In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett has been the person who's really challenged this head on,

212
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,440
and has very good evidence for the fact that such circuits probably don't exist.

213
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,340
And yet, I think there's good evidence for circuits in the brain,

214
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,350
such as limbic circuits and other circuits that shift our overall states,

215
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,730
or our overall level of alertness or calmness or whether or not they bias us

216
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,040
toward viewing the outside world or paying more attention to what's going on inside our bodies.

217
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,370
If none of this makes sense right now, I promise it will make sense soon.

218
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,440
But the important thing to understand is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.

219
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,490
They arise because there are specific connections between specific

220
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,840
areas in the brain and body.

221
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:10,050
And if we want to understand how emotions work, we have to look how emotions are built.

222
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:18,480
And they are built during infancy, adolescence, and puberty, and then it continues into adulthood,

223
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,890
but the groundwork is laid down early in development when we are small children.

224
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,400
So let's think about what happens to a baby that comes into the world.

225
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,760
A baby comes into the world you were born into this world,

226
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,930
without really any understanding of the things around you.

227
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,500
Now,

228
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,310
there are two ways that you can interact with the world and you're always doing them more or less,

229
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,920
to some degree at the same time.

230
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,990
Those are interoception paying attention what's going on inside you

231
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,370
what you feel internally and extra reception paying attention to what's going on

232
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,190
outside you hold that in mind please because

233
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,120
the fact that you're both intercepting and extra cepting

234
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,160
is true for your entire life and it sets the tone foundation for understanding emotions,

235
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,480
it's absolutely critical.

236
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,740
As an infant, you didn't have any knowledge of what you needed, you didn't understand hunger,

237
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,260
you didn't understand toys, when you first came into the world,

238
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,720
you didn't understand cold or heat or any of that.

239
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,640
When you needed something, you experienced that as anxiety,

240
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,130
you would feel an increase in alertness.

241
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,290
If you had to use the bathroom, you would feel an increase in alertness, if you were hungry,

242
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,320
and you would vocalize, you would cry out, you would act agitated, you might COO,

243
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,880
you might do a number of different things.

244
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,070
But all you knew was what you were fear feeling internally, and then your caregiver,

245
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,470
whoever that might have been, would respond to that.

246
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,580
So you would feel some agitation, a caregiver would come and make a decision, oh,

247
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:54,570
you need food and give you milk, or change your diaper, or wrap you in a blanket if you were cold.

248
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,470
But they didn't know if you were cold, they could just assume that you were cold.

249
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,210
So this is actually really important to understand that a baby when you were a baby.

250
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,570
And when I was a baby, we didn't have any sense of the outside world,

251
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,520
except that it responded to our acts of anxiety, essentially.

252
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,470
Now, this isn't Freudian theory, right?

253
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,920
It's it.

254
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,500
There are components of it that are embedded in Freudian theory.

255
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,940
But all developmental psychologists agree that babies lack the ability

256
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,370
to make cognitive sense of the outside world.

257
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,290
But in this feeling of anxiety, and registering one's own internal state,

258
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,390
and then crying out to the outside world, either through crying or subtle vocalizations,

259
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,850
or even just queueing making some noise,

260
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:41,070
we start to develop a relationship with the outside world in which our internal states,

261
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,850
our shifts and anxiety, start to drive requests.

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,480
And people come and respond to those requests, hopefully.

263
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:54,570
And the reason I say hopefully, is that we've all heard, presumably about these cases of neglect.

264
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,760
There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby, you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,

265
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,560
development doesn't go well.

266
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,850
And we'll touch on some of those.

267
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,850
But those are really extreme cases, they're sort of like the parallel

268
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,180
to experiments that are often done in the laboratory with animals,

269
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:12,180
where you've probably heard of these enriched environments where they will give

270
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,040
mice a bunch of toys, and they'll give them some different foods every once in a while,

271
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,750
and they'll house them together with other mice.

272
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,340
And what you find is that the animals, they will say, Oh, you know, their brain is thicker,

273
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,310
and their neurons have more branches to them and all that.

274
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,000
But that's really comparing deprivation with normalcy.

275
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,610
What we want to center on today instead, is what happens when things go well,

276
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,590
and why things might not go well, in certain circumstances is interesting,

277
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,220
but to me not as interesting as what healthy emotional development looks like.

278
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,290
And if you haven't achieved healthy emotional development,

279
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,880
what can be done as an intervention at later times in order to rescue that.

280
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,670
So the baby, you as a baby, you're flopping around there in your crib,

281
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,480
you're getting care where you where you need it and when you need it, presumably.

282
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,660
And this gets to the basis of what emotions are about which

283
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,540
emotions are really about forming bonds, and being able to predict things in the world.

284
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,150
That's really what emotions are about whether or not the baby feels angry, or happy or sad.

285
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,980
We don't know, we can guess.

286
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,580
But we don't know.

287
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,000
In fact, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel, let alone how other people feel.

288
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,170
And that's true for adults.

289
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,780
So if I asked you how you feel right now,

290
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:32,460
I don't know that you could tell me in any kind of rich language that would i would say,

291
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,990
Oh, I really understand.

292
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,020
If you said you were very, very depressed or very, very happy.

293
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,690
I'd have some sense because of how extreme that is.

294
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,160
But I don't know that I would really know.

295
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,230
And I don't think you know how I feel right now either.

296
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,790
I could be furious right now.

297
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,010
Or I could be very happy, you don't have any idea.

298
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,260
Of course, we have these things called expressions,

299
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,910
our pupils dilate their various cues of how people feel we're going to talk about those cues.

300
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,080
But you really don't know.

301
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,210
And at this point, I actually just want to pause and mention a really interesting tool

302
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,810
that is trying to address this question of what are emotions?

303
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,590
And what do they consist of, that you can use, if you like, this is an app,

304
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,840
I didn't develop it. I don't have any relationship to them.

305
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,810
But the app was developed by people at Yale.

306
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,970
Buy groups at Yale who do research and it's called mood meter.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
And it's actually quite interesting.

308
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,150
I think it's either free or it's 99 cents, again, no business relationship to them.

309
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:31,770
But what they're trying to do is put more nuance, more subtlety on our words in our language,

310
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,110
for emotions, and be able to, to allow you to predict how you're going to feel in the future.

311
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,250
And it's actually quite interesting.

312
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,570
I'm on the app right now.

313
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,630
And I know you can't see this, but it's called mood meter.

314
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:49,080
And you can find on Apple or Android and you go into it and as you know, it says to me, hi, Andrew,

315
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:54,930
how are you right now and I click the little tab that says I feel and I can either pick,

316
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,310
high energy and unpleasant high energy and pleasant

317
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,850
low Energy unpleasant or low energy pleasant.

318
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,790
And I would say right now, I feel high energy pleasant.

319
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,260
So I just revealed to you how I feel.

320
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,400
So I click on that.

321
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,520
And then it gives you a gallery of colors,

322
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,840
and you just move your finger to the location where you think it matches most.

323
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,800
And as you do that little

324
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,940
words pop up. I know some people are looking at this on Ott or listening to this on audio only.

325
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,780
So stay motivated, cheerful inspired, I would say I'm feeling right now cheerful.

326
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,070
So you click that.

327
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,220
And then you just go to the next window, and it just says, What are you doing, and I,

328
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,040
this feels like play to me, but I'm going to call it work.

329
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,060
And then that's it.

330
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,450
And then what it does is it basically starts to collect data on you, you're giving it information,

331
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,710
and it starts to link that to other features that you allow it access to, if you like,

332
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,090
and it starts helping you be able to predict how you're going to feel at different times a day,

333
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,690
it's actually quite accurate in certain ways, quite interesting.

334
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,380
And it points to a couple really interesting features,

335
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,420
which is that we don't really have enough language to describe all the emotional states.

336
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,740
And yet there are some core truths to what makes up an emotion.

337
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,160
And I want to review that twice during today's podcast.

338
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,070
Because this can really help people,

339
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,780
kids and adults understand better what they're feeling and why.

340
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,660
And when best to engage in certain activities.

341
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,210
And thankfully, when best to avoid certain activities to So the way this works is the following.

342
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,730
You need to ask yourself at any point, you could do this right now, if you like,

343
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,800
what's your level of autonomic arousal, autonomic arousal is just the continuum,

344
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,430
the range of alert to calm.

345
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,540
So if you're in a panic right now you are like 10 out of 10.

346
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,730
On the arousal scale.

347
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:50,850
If you're asleep, you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying, although maybe a little bit,

348
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,390
but let's say you're very drowsy, you might be at a one or a two.

349
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,950
So you always have to ask, Where are you on the arousal scale?

350
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,210
And then there's this other axis this other question, which is what we call Valence.

351
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,330
Now valence is of value, do you feel good or bad,

352
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,760
I would say I feel pretty good right now on a scale of one to 10.

353
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,950
I'm like, I don't know, I feel like a seven.

354
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:20,160
Got good night's sleep last night, had a good walk with Costello this morning, bed, I'm hydrated,

355
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,690
I feel good something a seven.

356
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,710
So I'm alert.

357
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,180
And I feel pretty good.

358
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,490
And then there's a third thing,

359
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,950
which is how much we are intercepting and how much we are ex terror receptive.

360
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,250
Alright, so how much our attention is focused internally,

361
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,030
on what we're feeling and how much it's focused externally.

362
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,450
And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.

363
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,950
So for instance, if you're really, really stressed, oftentimes,

364
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,250
that puts you in a position to be really in touch with what's going on in your body.

365
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,460
If you start having a lot of somatic a lot of bodily sensations,

366
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,100
like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it,

367
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,190
then you're really strongly interoceptive.

368
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,310
But also, sometimes you're really stressed because someone stressing you out,

369
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,140
or somebody sends you a text message or

370
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,060
makes a comment about a YouTube thing you posted or something and you're really triggered by it,

371
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,990
that never happens to me.

372
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,310
But it if it does happen to you, then you're extra receptive.

373
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,490
So these three things how alert or sleepy you are, that's one, how good or bad you feel that's too.

374
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,370
And then whether or not most of your attention is directed outward,

375
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,110
or whether or not it's directed inward.

376
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,970
And much of what we call emotions are made up by those three things.

377
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,120
And so let's return now to development.

378
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,730
But tuck that away and just kind of think about it alert versus asleep, good versus bad,

379
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,400
and focused internally or focus externally.

380
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,040
Because when I looked at the whole of the, all the theories of emotion that were out there,

381
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,780
there were a lot of different components to them.

382
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:53,130
But they all seem to center back to these same three features in some way,

383
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,540
or to some degree or another.

384
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,400
And it can be very powerful to understand and look at your emotions through that lens.

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
So let's return to the infant.

386
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,020
There's the baby in the crib.

387
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,120
It's mostly intercepting.

388
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:12,990
As caregivers bring it what it needs you hope milk, diaper changes, et cetera.

389
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,090
Warm blanket if it's cold,

390
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,200
pull off the blanket when the baby's fussing and it's too warm because babies get too warm.

391
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,660
Also, it starts to interest external cept Excuse me, I misspoke.

392
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,390
I want to be very clear, it starts to x Taro cept,

393
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,040
the baby starts to look into the outside world and start making predictions.

394
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,230
It starts wondering how much it needs to cry or predicting.

395
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,680
Well, if I cry like a little bit, then mom comes over and I get my milk.

396
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,180
Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't come over and give me milk.

397
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,700
So I need to really scream at the top of my head.

398
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,850
Okay, so babies are starting to evaluate and do all this but they're not doing it consciously.

399
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,050
They're doing this strategically in order to really Leave anxiety.

400
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,310
And I won't propose that that's what we do into adulthood.

401
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,870
But a lot of what we do in adulthood is when we feel something, we start exteroceptive.

402
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,180
Some people are much better just sitting as a container,

403
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,510
and just intercepting and paying attention to what they're feeling internally.

404
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,410
But most people do a little bit of a balance of both, we start, we don't feel good.

405
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,380
So we look for an item of food that might make us feel better.

406
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,680
We're feeling anxious, heading into the dentist or something like that.

407
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,730
So we text somebody, we do this almost reflexively, it's not always conscious.

408
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,750
So infants do this, and we continue to do this,

409
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,650
we start to now balance our interoceptive and extra receptive,

410
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,460
focus are looking inward and looking outward.

411
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,480
And as we do that, we're trying to figure out what gets our needs met.

412
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:50,700
Remember, emotions are really there to form bonds, and to make predictions.

413
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,850
And so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not.

414
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,890
Sometimes, sadly, there is neglect.

415
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,500
Sometimes people don't show up for us the way that we would like.

416
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:00,930
And in general,

417
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,990
our responses to that have to do with whether or not we predict whether or not they would or not,

418
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,420
when we expect something, and it doesn't happen.

419
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,380
It's a big letdown.

420
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,630
That was the discussion about dopamine last episode.

421
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,320
So

422
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,450
the many theories of emotion the triune brain theory that you have a primitive and evolved brain,

423
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,520
something that's a little bit on shaky ground these days,

424
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,660
the idea that Darwin proposed that there are these universal expressions of emotions,

425
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,180
the work of Helen Fisher on love that you have circuits in the brain for lost

426
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,320
circuits in the brain for love and circuits in the brain for long term bonds,

427
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,390
as well as the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett, saying that emotions are contextual,

428
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,890
that they have a social component.

429
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,240
And I'll be talking more about this, but the work of Allan schore,

430
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,270
a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA, about right brain left brain,

431
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,340
and its role in emotional development,

432
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,830
all of them have strong elements of this idea of paying attention to what's going on inward

433
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,940
and outward.

434
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:06,600
As a young creature, an infant and young toddler, you were mainly focused inward,

435
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,520
and you started to understand what was going on

436
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:14,130
outward as a way of predicting what would bring you relief, what would remove your anxiety.

437
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,320
And that's where the fundamental rules

438
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,140
of your experience your emotional experience were laid down.

439
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,110
I realized that's a lot of information.

440
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,180
And it's somewhat of an academic talk.

441
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,060
But there were two tools in there that I just want to highlight.

442
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,870
One is the mood meter app, if you're interested in it can give you some insight into the

443
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:34,980
different kinds of nuance within emotions and allow you to actually predict emotional states,

444
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,870
if you want to try that.

445
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,730
And you might find that interesting.

446
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,700
The other one is this idea that there are three axes to emotion, three continuum that interact,

447
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,510
the level of alertness and calmness, how good or bad you feel,

448
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,730
and whether or not you're mainly focused inward or outward,

449
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:55,440
because those are going to form a useful toolkit for the information going forward.

450
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,920
So now let's talk about what kind of baby you were.

451
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,250
Because that actually informs your emotionality.

452
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,650
Now, these are classic.

453
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,280
They're actually famous experiments done by Bowlby and Ainsworth,

454
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,000
anyone that studied psychology or has taken a psychology class might have learned about this.

455
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:19,830
This is this classic experiment of the what was called the strange situation task, in which,

456
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,320
and I'm describing it very coarsely, here,

457
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,060
I realized but a mother and child come into the laboratory.

458
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,670
Yes, this has now also been done with fathers.

459
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:37,470
The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit, and then the mother leaves.

460
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,970
The mother leaves for some period of time and then comes back.

461
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:49,230
And the research is devoted to understanding the response of the child when

462
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,320
the caretaker the mother of the Father returns.

463
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,650
Most all children, not every child,

464
00:28:55,650 --> 00:29:01,320
but most children will cry when their primary caretaker leaves, they don't like that.

465
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,690
And there are good reasons for that

466
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,140
they formed a bond and an attachment and we will talk about some of the deeper

467
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,570
chemical reasons for those bonds.

468
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,850
However, the experiment is focused on the return of the caregiver,

469
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,970
because Bowlby and Ainsworth and many of their scientific offspring and colleagues

470
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:29,190
identified at least four patterns that babies display when their caretaker returns.

471
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,790
And they group these into Group A, B, C, D,

472
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:39,060
so much so that the kids were referred to as a babies B babies see babies or D babies.

473
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,980
You may know which one you were, but the categories are really interesting.

474
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,230
The first babies are the A babies.

475
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,290
So these were kids that would get upset when their caretaker would leave.

476
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,230
But when their caretaker would return,

477
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,550
the infant would respond with happiness with what looked like delight.

478
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,080
They would go to the caretaker, they seemed happy if they had been fussy Before sad,

479
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,340
they felt relieved.

480
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:06,989
These are referred to as secure attached kids.

481
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:11,489
So they have a healthy response to separation and they have a healthy response

482
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,069
to re engaging with the caretaker.

483
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,499
The B babies, as they're called,

484
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:23,129
were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver when the caregiver would return.

485
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:27,239
So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys or they would

486
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,589
be with the they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone, they would stay with them.

487
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,379
It was sometimes complicated and nuanced, but these were referred to as avoidant babies.

488
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:41,669
Don't run away with any conclusions about the language here just yet.

489
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:45,419
It's not clear that avoidant babies become avoidant adults.

490
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:47,039
But bear with me,

491
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:54,899
the see babies would respond to the return of the caregiver with acts of annoyance,

492
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,939
they seem kind of angry, right.

493
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,879
So it wasn't that they ignored them, they seem kind of angry.

494
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,819
And those were referred to as ambivalent babies.

495
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:06,869
Not to be confused with a babies these are the see babies were the ambivalent babies.

496
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:11,819
So the infant's reaction to the returning caregiver were inconsistent.

497
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:17,339
They seemed like they wanted to bond with them again, but that they seem kind of annoyed.

498
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,119
I think we've all felt this way before with people that we care very much about,

499
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,099
especially people we care very much about.

500
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:27,059
And then the third category, the D babies were the disorganized babies.

501
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:27,869
That's what they call them.

502
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:29,639
They weren't disorganized, and that they were messy.

503
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:35,729
The child avoided interactions with everyone and acted fearful when the caregiver returned.

504
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,989
And their behavior didn't really change whether or not the caregiver was there or not.

505
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:43,979
And that fourth category was actually added rather late in the course of this research.

506
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,629
I should mention these

507
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:50,699
experiments have been repeated with a huge variety of different contexts.

508
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:55,559
There was work done by Mary main at at UC Berkeley and many others,

509
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:58,589
looking at all sorts of variations on this theme.

510
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,789
But over time, it made it clear that certain babies

511
00:32:03,239 --> 00:32:09,899
are able to feel secure upon re engaging with their caregiver and others don't,

512
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,459
or they're confused about it.

513
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:17,459
So we probably don't know whether or not you were an A or B, or C, D, baby,

514
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:19,229
unless you were in these experiments.

515
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:20,669
And somehow you had that knowledge.

516
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:27,179
But this work, this classic work opened up a huge set of important questions

517
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:32,909
that relate to what is the reestablishment of the bond really about I mean, what's actually being

518
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:36,479
figured out here is not whether or not there are four categories of babies.

519
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:41,159
That's interesting, but it presumably is more interesting to focus on.

520
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:45,119
What is it that defines a really good bond,

521
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,079
a secure attachment or an insecure attachment or an avoidant attachment.

522
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:58,319
And the four things are gaze, literally eye contact, and doesn't have to be direct beaming

523
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,339
eye contact with no blinks like people have accused me up before it can just be gaze that you know,

524
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:03,149
people look at each other.

525
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:06,479
You see couples, they look at each other, they don't always stare each other long periods of time,

526
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:10,139
sometimes they do vocal vocalizations.

527
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:17,640
So what we say and how we say it, an effect or emotion, so the way that we express, you know, crying,

528
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,110
smiling, etc.

529
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,990
And touch those four things.

530
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:27,120
And you probably could add a fifth dimension once language and written language develops,

531
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,950
which is written word, exchange of letters, exchange of texts, exchange of things of that sort.

532
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,990
Emails are another way in which people can bond, but gaze vocalization,

533
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:44,250
effect and touch are really the core of this thing that we call social bonds and emotionality.

534
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,140
Now, that's important.

535
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,100
We know for instance, that there are brain areas like the fusiform face area,

536
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,840
which is deep in the brain that is responsible for the processing of faces,

537
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,840
children's recognition of their parents Faces and Voices is extremely accurate and strong.

538
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:06,570
Likewise, parents recognition of their child's vocalizations, not just voices,

539
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,580
but cries are remarkable.

540
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,480
If you've ever had the experience of being in a party with somebody who has small children,

541
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,570
you're talking to them and all of a sudden they, they hear something, but you don't.

542
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,650
It's as if they've got wolf hearing, and all of a sudden, they go running into the other room.

543
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,350
And indeed, the you know, the kid is like, I don't know,

544
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:26,550
some kid is beating up their kid or their kids beating up some other kid or the kid has done

545
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,010
injure themselves or feels emotionally injured.

546
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,660
This perception of voices,

547
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:35,490
there's very good evidence to support the fact that we are tuned to the frequencies of,

548
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,700
of voices and vocalizations of people that we care about.

549
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,490
It's not just true in rodents and birds and other mammals.

550
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,230
It's definitely true in humans as well.

551
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:47,790
And babies are very tuned in to the sound of their, of their mother's voice, even Yes,

552
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,780
while they're in the womb.

553
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:54,330
There's this whole world of what's called mother ease, which is the the particular

554
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,940
style of speech that mothers and other caretakers now we know use with children.

555
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,830
So those are the core elements, right?

556
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,000
How you look at somebody and how they look at you what you say what they say,

557
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,370
what they seem to be feeling.

558
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,450
And how that makes you feel smiles frowns if you know someone really well,

559
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,980
you can read inflections in like, even little subtle things like, you know, they don't,

560
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:23,370
they don't really believe me or Oh, they, they're really excited by this or Oh,

561
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,330
you know, now I know what they're thinking, that kind of processing.

562
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,550
Some people are better at it than others.

563
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,580
But everyone's better at doing that with people that we recognize and know.

564
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,230
In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well, so much so that

565
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,570
it can both benefit and injure their relationship to constantly be making these perceptions.

566
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:45,630
But there's a range, some people are more tuned into this than others.

567
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,670
And that probably has roots in the sorts of attachments that you form early on.

568
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,260
So Bowlby and colleagues developed these ABCD thing.

569
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,690
And it has a lot to do with face processing,

570
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,790
and gaze and vocalizations and touch all of those happened on return with the mother,

571
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,960
but they weren't parsing those.

572
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,340
They weren't looking at them individually.

573
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:13,380
So this raises a really interesting question, which is, what is it when we feel something,

574
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,150
Is it because of something that happened spontaneously in us, it's a memory,

575
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,990
or it's something that we realized we saw on the internet, or we got news about somebody,

576
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,410
you know, nowadays, people get so much information about the people they know,

577
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,450
but the people they like and dislike by way of viewing online activities, right,

578
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,740
so they're extra cepting.

579
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,600
And then it's impacting your internal state.

580
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,870
And it's clear from most all of the theories of emotional health, that an ability

581
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,410
to recognize when your own internal state is being driven primarily by external events,

582
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,240
as important for being able to emotionally regulate, right,

583
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,230
people who are constantly being yanked around by the external happenings in the world,

584
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,360
you would say, are emotionally labile, they are not in control of their emotions.

585
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,610
Even if they're calm all the time.

586
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,690
If that calmness only arrives because they're in a placid environment, and then you put,

587
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,750
you know, a cracker in that environment, and they freak out, well,

588
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,080
then they're not really calm they are they're calm,

589
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,930
insofar as there is in something disturbing in the environment.

590
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,890
So how much you're the outside environment disrupts your internal environment

591
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,320
has everything to do with this balance of interoception.

592
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,030
And an extra reception and it very likely has roots in whether or not you were secure,

593
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,800
attached or insecure, attached, disorganized or ambivalent, as a baby.

594
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,110
Of course, you can't travel back in time and no,

595
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,460
but there are some hints as to what kind of emotionality each of us has,

596
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,580
by examining two periods of development.

597
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,600
One is adolescence and puberty, and the other is adulthood.

598
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,640
So while we can't travel back in time,

599
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,920
there is an exercise that you can do to address at least in this moment,

600
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,750
whether or not you have a bias for extra reception, or a bias for interoception.

601
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,350
Whether or not you are better, at least in this moment,

602
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,070
at paying attention to what's going on internally, or externally.

603
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,320
And of course, this will vary with circumstance.

604
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,960
I think we all know people that maybe it's you, you go to a party, and you get there,

605
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,870
and everyone seems to be talking and having a really good time.

606
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,350
And you're wondering whether or not you have any food in your teeth,

607
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,820
or whether or not there's something on your face,

608
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,260
or whether or not your hair is right or whether or not you said something the wrong way,

609
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,580
whether or not you're turning red, people also experienced this a lot with public speaking.

610
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,960
And it's not just about learning to clamp your level of stress.

611
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,440
It's also about how much you're extra cepting how much you're out of your head,

612
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:43,500
they call it but how much you're focused on the events around you, versus the events inside you.

613
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:49,380
Actually, it's interesting when you talk to people who are very effective athletes,

614
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,760
or they have very high stress, high consequence jobs, they talk about this notion of you know,

615
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,300
getting out of your head, you only have so much attentional resource.

616
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,730
And it can be split between two things, you'll see that in a moment, that can be anchored to one thing,

617
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:06,000
it can be fully focused on what's going on internally,

618
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,250
or it can be fully focused on what's going on externally.

619
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,820
And if you want to be effective in the world, effective being in quotes,

620
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,060
it is useful when in very dynamic environments, especially social environments,

621
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,820
to have a lot of your attention focused outward,

622
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,020
as opposed to try and do pay attention to whether or not you're saying things correctly,

623
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,850
or the tambour of your own voice that is

624
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:31,530
more or less destructive for the ability to engage socially.

625
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,080
So here's the exercise.

626
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,320
You can do this, please don't do this if you're driving.

627
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,140
But let's just try and

628
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,690
illustrate or allow you to experience this interoceptive extra receptive balance

629
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,910
and the extent to which you can move interoception and extra reception deliberately.

630
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,540
If you close your eyes right now,

631
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:01,830
and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body with The chair or your car seat,

632
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,630
although please, again, don't do this while you're driving.

633
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,440
Anywhere that you are, even if you're just standing up or you're in the kitchen,

634
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,730
relying on the couch,

635
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,510
and trying to bring as much of your attention to that point of contact as possible.

636
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:20,190
And then from there, you're going to move your attention even more deeply into, say,

637
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,380
the sensation of what's going on in your gut.

638
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,040
Are you full?

639
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,880
Are you empty?

640
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,720
Are you hungry?

641
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,190
Are you not, is your heart beating at what rate what's the cadence of your breathing,

642
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,420
basically bringing your

643
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,530
focus and attention to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.

644
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,710
So I'm going to do a rare thing on the Huberman lab podcast,

645
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,170
I'm going to introduce about five to eight seconds of silence

646
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,450
in order to allow you to do that a little bit.

647
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,890
Okay, now,

648
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:01,020
this is an exercise that you can continue afterward if you want to extend how long you do this.

649
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,100
But now try and do something that for most people actually is a little bit harder,

650
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,070
which is to purely extra OSEP, put, put your eyes or your ears or both,

651
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,890
on anything in your immediate space.

652
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,180
One thing and I would restrict that thing to something small enough

653
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:24,060
that at least in your field of view, it would occupy, you know, 20% of your field of view.

654
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,120
So it doesn't have to be a pin point, unless the pin is right in front of you,

655
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,890
and you're holding it real close, I would say look across the room, pick a panel on the wall,

656
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,210
or you know,

657
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:38,460
a leg of a table or something and try and bring as much of your attention to that as possible.

658
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,280
And again, I'll take about five seconds of silence to allow you to zero cept.

659
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,900
Okay, so what you probably found is that you're able to do that,

660
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,620
but that some degree of interoception is maintained,

661
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:04,260
it's hard to place 100% of your attention on something externally, unless it's really exciting,

662
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,250
really novel.

663
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:10,050
If you've ever watched a really great movie, presumably you're extra accepting

664
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,050
more than you're intercepting until something exciting happens.

665
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:14,790
And then and then you feel something you're actually

666
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,820
tethering your emotional experience to something external.

667
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:24,900
And now, you can also do this dynamically, you can decide to focus internally, and then externally,

668
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:31,080
you can decide to split it 50% 50% or 7031 can develop,

669
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,730
you can develop a heightened ability to do this.

670
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,740
And the power of

671
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:42,060
doing that is actually that when you are in environments where you feel like you're focused too

672
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,480
much internally, and you'd like to be focused more externally,

673
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,220
you can actually do that deliberately.

674
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,110
But as you notice, it takes work.

675
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,910
It involves taking your attentional spotlight, and what we call the aperture of your attention,

676
00:42:54,330 --> 00:43:00,390
and narrowing that aperture to either the self or something externally or splitting the two.

677
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,360
And yet, there are practices that

678
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:10,440
have been developed that center on moving interoception and extra reception from one

679
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,540
being more heavily weighted than the other more focused outward or more focused inward.

680
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,100
And its dynamic.

681
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,910
And the circuits in the brain that underlie internal and external reception

682
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,420
aren't exactly known, but they are anchored in the areas of the brain,

683
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,440
they're involved in attention,

684
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,820
like the frontal eye fields and areas that when you third person yourself,

685
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,510
when you can see yourself doing something like if you put your hand out in your environment,

686
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:37,710
and you focus on your hand, you know that that's your hand, as opposed to some random object,

687
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,720
there are areas of the brain that are involved in

688
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,400
that in recognizing the location of self relative to the rest of your body.

689
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:52,800
These exercises are really what are at the core of these development of emotional bonds.

690
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,220
Because as we mentioned before, these four things, the gaze, vocalization, touch an effect,

691
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,130
those are happening very dynamically.

692
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,920
So if somebody winks at you, you're paying attention to their wink,

693
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,280
but then you're also notice how you feel, then they might say something,

694
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,230
then you might say something, this is very dynamic.

695
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,880
So if it seems overwhelming to try and intercept an extra step, and then shift the balance,

696
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,660
you do that all the time, your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.

697
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:25,110
Now, some people have a very hard time breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.

698
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,550
Some people have a harder time breaking out of their extra receptive mode.

699
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,860
It's very interesting to note

700
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:37,710
the the extent to which we have biases and how interoceptive or extra receptive we are.

701
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,480
Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier, you have valence, good or bad,

702
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,260
you have alertness, alert, or calm and you have interoceptive or extra receptive bias, right.

703
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,880
And it's going to differ across the day, it's going to differ across the lifetime.

704
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,090
It's certainly going to differ according to whatever it is that you're engaged in.

705
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:02,010
But early in development, you start off with this interoceptive bias,

706
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,100
you're starting to develop expectations,

707
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,160
predictions about how the outside world is going to work.

708
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,680
And you're trying to figure out the reliability of outside events and people,

709
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,380
and where things are reliable.

710
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,200
When people are reliable, we are able to give up more of our interoception.

711
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,860
There's literally trust that our interoceptive needs,

712
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:29,850
our internal needs will be met through bonds and actions of others.

713
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,500
This starts to veer toward the discussion about neglect and trauma,

714
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,600
we are going to devote entire episodes probably an entire month to trauma and PTSD.

715
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,830
But these, those have roots in what we're talking about now.

716
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:43,920
And

717
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,460
it's important to internalize and understand what we're talking about now in order to get the

718
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,440
most out of those future conversations.

719
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:54,600
So if all of this seems like a lot of information, and very complicated,

720
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,270
I just invite you to pay attention from time to time

721
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:00,330
how much you happen to be intercepting or extra cepting.

722
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:06,150
Because emotions and the intensity of those emotions will grow or shrink,

723
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,890
depending on how much we're intercepting.

724
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,200
If we are feeling extremely sad.

725
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:17,880
And there is an outside event that made us sad, chances are, there's going to be a balance,

726
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,760
but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness is going to lead us to mostly intercept.

727
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,200
Whereas when, when we're feeling extremely happy, the same is true,

728
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,480
you know, something great happens in the world.

729
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,060
And we're just going to feel it most of our perception,

730
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,610
most of our awareness is going to be on an internal state.

731
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,630
So we are always tethered to the outside world to some degree or another.

732
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,940
It's that was true when you were an infant.

733
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,100
And it was true when you're an adolescent.

734
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,320
And it's true as an adult.

735
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,450
So now I want to just pause,

736
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,220
just shelve the discussion about interoception extra reception for a moment.

737
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:59,490
And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most if not equally important

738
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,170
aspect of your development, as it relates to emotionality.

739
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,990
And as it relates to this, what I called trust.

740
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:12,150
But this ability to predict whether or not things in the outside world are reliable or not

741
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:17,010
reliable in terms of their ability to help you meet your interoceptive needs.

742
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,220
And that period is puberty.

743
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,400
So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology,

744
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,470
not a lot of biology and not a lot of mechanism.

745
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:30,630
And now we're going to transition into talking about mechanism, hormones, receptors, etc.

746
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,530
Puberty is a absolute biological event.

747
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,510
It has a beginning.

748
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:42,330
And it has a specific definition, which is the transition into reproductive maturity.

749
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,220
So there are a lot of hormonal changes.

750
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,070
Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes, and most people don't realize it,

751
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,690
but the brain changes occur.

752
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:53,760
First, the brain turns on the hormone systems that allow puberty to occur.

753
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,180
Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays than it did in the past.

754
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:06,720
The current numbers that I was able to find is that in females, girls,

755
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,390
the transition is starting around age 10.

756
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,880
Whereas in boys, it's about age 12, that's going to differ by way of a number of different factors.

757
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,930
Those are averages.

758
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,980
So depends on where you are in the world depends on all sorts of things.

759
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,750
One of the primary triggers for puberty is actually body fat.

760
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,580
This is interesting.

761
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:30,090
The peptide hormone leptin.

762
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,220
Some people call it a peptide.

763
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,890
Some people call it a hormone, but it meets both definitions,

764
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,220
depending on how you look at it is made by fat.

765
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:46,350
So leptin had a lot of popularity in the 90s because it was discovered as being produced by fat.

766
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,130
And it was seen in animal studies that it could promote leanness,

767
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:54,360
it actually communicates to the brain that there's enough body fat in order

768
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:59,730
to allow the metabolic factors and processes to occur to liberate more fat.

769
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,730
This is why people have trouble losing that last five pounds.

770
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,620
It's because leptin levels are very low.

771
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,360
This was actually the basis for the whole cheat day refeed thing that the idea was if you

772
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:13,170
eat a lot for one day a week while dieting hard,

773
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,320
that you can signal to the brain that there's enough leptin.

774
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,610
I don't know if that's

775
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,480
the reason or whether or not the cheat days just provided some psychological relief,

776
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,350
probably both.

777
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:27,270
But in any case, leptin is made by body fat, and when there's enough leptin,

778
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,390
it signals the brain to trigger puberty.

779
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:34,500
There was a paper published in the mid 90s in the journal Science,

780
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:42,000
excellent journal showing that leptin could be injected into younger females that would not

781
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,430
have yet gone into puberty and you could accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin.

782
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,580
So more body fat, the earlier puberty, that's true.

783
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:56,100
Leptin is also involved in various growth effects in the body generally, and it's interesting,

784
00:49:56,370 --> 00:50:01,800
very obese children don't necessarily undergo puberty The earlier sometimes they do,

785
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,480
but they do tend to be larger bone, their bones actually grow more quickly and they tend to have

786
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,810
higher bone density because leptin is also involved in bone density.

787
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:17,520
The whole issue of onset of puberty also has some really interesting social effects.

788
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:22,740
And I want to really highlight that most of these effects are so called pheromone effects.

789
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:26,340
Remember, a hormone is a substance secreted from one area of the body travels

790
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,250
and impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.

791
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,920
A pheromone is a chemical that's released by one member of a species that goes in acts

792
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,510
on and impacts other members of that species or even other species.

793
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,280
So for instance, rodents are very good at detecting the

794
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,350
the urine and the scent markings of large carnivores that want to eat them.

795
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,480
So that's a pheromonal interaction.

796
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,160
Whether or not they're pheromonal effects in humans is very debated.

797
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,060
I did a post on

798
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,600
this on Instagram a little while ago about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.

799
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,560
And I had a couple of people come at me saying, Look,

800
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,250
it's never really been shown in humans that there's a pheromonal vomer,

801
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,370
what's called the vomeronasal organ, there's something called Jacobson's organ.

802
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,750
It's rudimentary.

803
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,790
Some people have it, some people don't.

804
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,590
Very controversial.

805
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:20,760
So I want to point out that human pheromone effects are controversial, although I think there's,

806
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,830
in my opinion, there's ample evidence for them synchronization of menstrual cycles.

807
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:31,230
For many people report, then people say, there's some studies that show that it's not true,

808
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:39,840
then there have been some data showing very impressive pheromonal effects of female partners,

809
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,060
being able to detect the odor

810
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,810
of their significant others on T shirts that were washed several times,

811
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,250
so they can't consciously perceive it.

812
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,350
But they say this one smells like them.

813
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,760
This one smells like my partner.

814
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:55,350
And indeed, the The match was way above chance.

815
00:51:55,620 --> 00:52:00,480
So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects, at least in my opinion, when I look at the data,

816
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,010
but much more needs to be done.

817
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:08,610
So one of the more interesting pheromone effects that impacts puberty, at least in animal models,

818
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,980
is the so called vandenberghe effect, which is if you take a pre pubertal female,

819
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,970
so a female that has not undergone sexual maturation,

820
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:24,450
and you introduce a novel male that is not the father or a brother, not a sibling,

821
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,950
she will undergo puberty almost immediately.

822
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,600
So this is really striking.

823
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,050
For years.

824
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:33,510
This was thought not to occur in primate species.

825
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,620
But there was a paper published last year in Current Biology cell press journal,

826
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,240
excellent journal, showing that mandrels a particular type of primate,

827
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,330
they exhibit this Vandenberg effect.

828
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,920
There are also all sorts of other pheromone effects.

829
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,490
There's the the most infamous one is called the Bruce effect,

830
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,000
where the introduction of a novel male,

831
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,840
to a pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage.

832
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,670
And that effect seems to be protected against by the presence of the Father.

833
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:14,700
So another, you know, that these interpretation of this, and I want to really highlight that this is,

834
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,140
these are animal studies.

835
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,920
But

836
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:25,620
the way this works is that if a pregnant female is in the company of the male that impregnated her,

837
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:33,480
then her young are protected by his scent presence or his pheromone presence, but if he's gone,

838
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:40,920
and a novel male shows up, there's a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry, and essentially,

839
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,440
for the fetus to be lost.

840
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:47,580
Now, whether or not this occurs in humans is still very controversial.

841
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:50,610
But nonetheless, these pheromone effects exist.

842
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:56,040
And that one is called the Bruce effect, named after Hilda Bruce,

843
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,560
who is the scientist that discovered it.

844
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:02,940
The one that's relevant to the puberty discussion is the Vandenberg effect,

845
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:07,530
which I mentioned a few minutes ago, which is a novel male showing up.

846
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:13,590
Second, it has to be a sexually competent male, so he has to have already passed through puberty, and

847
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:16,650
his presence triggers activation of

848
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,630
puberty in a female that otherwise would have remained pre pubertal for longer.

849
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:24,270
Again, whether or not this happens in humans unclear.

850
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,380
Well, what can we be sure about?

851
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,220
When we think about puberty, puberty is triggered by a number of

852
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:36,450
different factors there changes in GABA expression in the brain and inhibitory transmitter.

853
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:41,220
One of the more interesting molecules that triggers puberty in all individuals

854
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:49,410
is something called kisspeptin k i s s PEPTIN kisspeptin.

855
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,250
Kisspeptin is made by the brain and it stimulates

856
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,080
large amounts of different hormone called gnrh.

857
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,960
Gonadotropin releasing hormone To be released,

858
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,980
gonadotropin releasing hormone then causes the release of another hormone called something

859
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:06,780
called luteinizing.

860
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,920
Hormone Lh,

861
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:13,410
which travels in the bloodstream and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen.

862
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,860
And the testes of males to produce testosterone.

863
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,370
Kisspeptin has other effects as well.

864
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,990
But those are some of the main ones as they relate to puberty.

865
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,520
This is interesting because at this point, the testes

866
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,570
in males start churning out tons of testosterone in order to trigger

867
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,350
the development of secondary sexual characteristics, body hair,

868
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:39,120
and all the others deepening a voice etc.

869
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,610
And then females estrogen is doing various other things, breast development, etc.

870
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,790
Normally, in an adult, somebody who is past puberty,

871
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,940
a big increase in gonadotropin releasing hormone,

872
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,550
and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut down.

873
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,160
Because the way that the brain works,

874
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:03,690
the hypothalamus and the pituitary are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood.

875
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,350
And if testosterone or estrogen or any other hormone goes too high,

876
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,890
they shut down the release of things like luteinizing hormone,

877
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,050
it's a way to call the negative feedback loop.

878
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:14,880
It basically is like a thermostat in the house.

879
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,200
It's more complicated than that.

880
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,220
But once levels get too high in the bloodstream, it shuts down.

881
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,890
But kisspeptin is able to drive very

882
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:27,990
high levels of these hormones in an ongoing way so that puberty can commence and can continue.

883
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,650
And incidentally, kisspeptin has now become yet another of the panoply of

884
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,160
hormones and peptides and cocktails that

885
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:42,870
athletes take in order to try and stimulate natural hormone production, essentially,

886
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:48,150
to create their own performance enhancing drugs endogenously no judgement there.

887
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:48,930
But that's a fact.

888
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,610
There's a lot of kisspeptin use people.

889
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,250
I'm not I truly not suggesting anyone do this.

890
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,330
But people are buying and injecting kisspeptin for the

891
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,200
specific reason that even past puberty can stimulate

892
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:06,240
the large increases in things like estrogen, large increases in testosterone,

893
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,110
and things of that sort,

894
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:13,170
as a number of psychological effects to seems to have big effects on libido, etc.

895
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,880
All these things, of course, are subject to feedback loops, so they don't work indefinitely.

896
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,280
And I'm gonna highlight again, I'm not suggesting anyone do it.

897
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,710
But I do like to pay attention to what's out there.

898
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,040
And kisspeptin because it wasn't discovered that long ago

899
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,170
is one of the things that you don't often hear about.

900
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,990
When people talk about performance enhancing drugs, or therapeutic endocrinology,

901
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,520
these things also have therapeutic uses in the endocrine setting.

902
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:43,530
So for instance, kids that don't undergo puberty or kids that are hypogonadal are adults,

903
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:47,610
they're hypo canal, they're not making enough hormone will take things like kisspeptin,

904
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,260
among other things.

905
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:54,780
So that's how puberty happens at the biological level gets triggered by leptin and kisspeptin.

906
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:02,190
And then this young child is now a different creature, to some, to some extent,

907
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,580
not just because they're reproductively competent, of course,

908
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:11,490
but because there's a shift in a number of the things that underlie these social bonds.

909
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:15,900
There are, there's a market shift in a number of the things that

910
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,230
allow children and adults to engage in predictive behavior about each other.

911
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:30,060
And the whole nature of adolescence and puberty is to take a child that was a generalist,

912
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,890
and to make them a specialist.

913
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,880
And this is very important as it relates to the conversation about emotionality.

914
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:40,800
But it's important in terms of all aspects of brain function,

915
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,810
and in terms of learning and in terms of who each and every one of us will and has become

916
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,560
in adolescence and in childhood.

917
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:54,390
Sure, there are some genetic biases, you know, hair color, eye color, height,

918
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:56,550
and things like that a lot of that's programmed into the genome.

919
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:06,390
There are other genetic biases too, of course, that we inherit, but it's in adolescence and puberty,

920
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,610
that we go from essentially being somewhat good at a bunch of things, or

921
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,550
somewhat poor in a bunch of things to be coming

922
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:18,300
very good at a few things and very poor at a lot of other things.

923
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,930
And that's because of the relationship between puberty and neuroplasticity.

924
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,430
This ability

925
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:28,410
to change the brain in response to experience is starting to taper off such that by our early 20s,

926
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,660
it's harder to achieve.

927
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,540
Now, the transition from generalist to specialist is one aspect of adolescence and puberty.

928
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:43,470
But the other is the formation of social and emotional bonds and most of what consumes the minds

929
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,900
and waking hours

930
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,740
of adolescents and children who have gone through puberty and going through puberty.

931
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:56,040
His questions about how they relate to social structures, who they can rely on,

932
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,450
and how they can make

933
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,890
reliable predictions in the world now that they have more agency that they are physically

934
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:02,850
changed.

935
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,340
In fact, you could argue that puberty

936
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,180
is the fastest rate of maturation that you'll go through at any point in your life,

937
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:14,040
it's the largest change that you'll go through at any point in your life in terms of who you are.

938
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,600
Because your biology is fundamentally changed at the level of your brain, and your,

939
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:22,560
your bodily organs, all your organs, from the skin inward.

940
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,090
So I want to visit a little bit of the research about

941
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:33,180
some of the core needs that occurred during puberty and adolescence, not just for parents,

942
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,030
or for the people that might be in puberty and adolescence,

943
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:40,290
but also so that people can reflect on which of these sort of

944
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:46,260
boxes were checked off for them as they approached, emotional matcher maturity.

945
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,630
So there's a terrific review article that was published in the journal Nature, which is,

946
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:57,720
if not the premier, then certainly among the top three premier journals, in the field of science,

947
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:03,480
about the biology of adolescence, and puberty, as well as

948
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,840
some of the core needs and demands that have to be met for successful emotional maturation.

949
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,650
During that time.

950
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,810
We will provide a link to that.

951
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:18,180
But I just want to highlight a few of the things that they place in the final table,

952
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,010
I don't want to go through all the results right now,

953
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:21,720
because you could do that on your own if you like,

954
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:27,330
they mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons and neural circuits.

955
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,030
For instance, I'll just highlight one, there's a

956
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:35,130
connection between the dopamine centers in the brain and an area of the brain that's involved in

957
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,260
emotion and dispersal.

958
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,240
Dispersal is very interesting.

959
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:45,420
What you observe in animals and humans, is that around the end of adolescence,

960
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,160
and during the transition to puberty,

961
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:51,210
both because of changes in the brain and changes in hormones.

962
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,570
There's an intense desire on the part of the child to

963
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:03,120
get further and further away from primary caregivers, not permanently,

964
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:05,100
they always return similar to a child that

965
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,940
walks off and then looks back and sees if everything safe and then continues on.

966
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,550
During adolescence and puberty.

967
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,980
Both in animals and in kids.

968
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,740
There's it almost seems like there's a bias for action.

969
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,820
And the action is always in the direction away from the primary caregiver.

970
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,550
Now, as soon as I say that, I can just imagine in my mind that somebody out there saying, Well, no, my kid,

971
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,400
as soon as they hit puberty, they just want to stay home with us all the time.

972
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,440
That's not typical, it happens.

973
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,400
But it's not typical.

974
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,730
Mostly, there's a desire to start spending more time with friends,

975
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:39,060
more time with peers and less time with adults.

976
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,750
And I find it extremely interesting to note that that's not just true in humans,

977
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,760
that's true in other primate species.

978
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:46,320
That's true in rodents.

979
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,560
That's true in almost every other mammalian species.

980
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,230
So there's something about these hormones that don't just allow sexual reproduction.

981
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,310
They don't just change the brain and bodily organs and the shape of of us.

982
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,740
They also bias

983
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:06,270
us towards dispersal getting further and further away from primary caregivers in particular.

984
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:10,830
So parents of teenagers or future teenagers, it is not just normal,

985
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:17,760
it is baked in to the biology of humans to disperse around adolescence and in the teen years.

986
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,370
So again, I just want to highlight a few of these,

987
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:27,270
what were listed as intervention strategies to promote healthy adolescence.

988
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:31,950
And puberty is very interesting because that entire article I should mention,

989
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,590
the who wrote this article, apologies.

990
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,500
One of them as a friend of mine.

991
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,480
So the first author is Dr.

992
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,030
Ronald doll, not the children's book author,

993
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:47,310
I'm assuming no from the School of Public Health at University of California, Berkeley.

994
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:54,480
And Nicholas Allen, Linda will Brecht and Anna ballon Hoff Suleiman,

995
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,710
forgive me for the pronunciation.

996
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:56,160
Last one.

997
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,600
I know, Dr.

998
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,430
Willrich quite well, she's done.

999
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:03,540
The work on dispersal is quite well known for that work.

1000
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:06,990
And it's a very extensive review.

1001
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:10,080
But I think you can find it, you'll find it accessible,

1002
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,190
lot of changes and thickness of the brain at different stages, etc.

1003
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:20,220
But I think most people will be interested in what that translates to, in the in the real world.

1004
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:27,090
And what's interesting is, during puberty, there's increased connection connectivity,

1005
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:31,890
as we call it, between the prefrontal cortex which is involved in motivation and decision making,

1006
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:37,470
being able to suppress action for making long term goals possible,

1007
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,920
as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.

1008
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:44,520
So there's this really broad integration and testing.

1009
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,370
I think this is the key element here testing of circuits

1010
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,670
for emotions and reward as they relate to decisions.

1011
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,650
And I think that's useful because when you look at the behavior of adolescents and teens,

1012
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,510
they are testing social interactions.

1013
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,970
They are testing physical interactions with the world.

1014
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,790
Oftentimes, they're engaging in unsafe behavior.

1015
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:09,390
And you can't just I would never try and justify that with with the underlying neurology.

1016
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,730
But the neuroscience points to

1017
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:17,310
increased connectivity between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality and

1018
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:21,450
to threat detection, like the amygdala, but also reward.

1019
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:27,000
So it's a time of testing behaviorally, how different behaviors lead to success or not.

1020
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,960
It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.

1021
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,640
Now, of course, you could say that of any stage of development, but it seems like puberty is a is a very,

1022
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,220
very heightened stage in which testing of contingencies good or bad, is taking place.

1023
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:46,560
And of course, this is happening, it's operating in a body that's now more capable than the infant.

1024
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,800
So an infant can can damage themselves through error.

1025
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:53,940
But it's harder for them to damage themselves through deliberate planning,

1026
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,780
you know, that's why it's important, of course, to lock up all the medications in the house,

1027
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,340
make sure infants can get to them.

1028
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,790
But it's not likely that the infant is

1029
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:08,790
going to devise an extremely diabolical plan to get into the cabinet to get a certain substance,

1030
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,250
whereas a teenager might write.

1031
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:16,980
So you can start to map the neurology onto some of this emotional exploration,

1032
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,080
I do realize that this episode is about emotions.

1033
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,070
Puberty is a time in which the internal state of

1034
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:27,390
the person or the animal is being sampled and tested against

1035
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:33,630
different extra receptive events only now they are able to guide those events with more agency,

1036
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:34,530
right?

1037
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,120
It's no longer just about whether or not the caregiver is bringing you milk or bringing you food.

1038
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,540
Now, of course, the parents will all say, Yeah, but I'm paying for everything that they're doing.

1039
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,400
I'm paying for the car, and I'm paying for the food.

1040
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:45,510
True.

1041
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:52,320
But the biology doesn't care about the source, the child or the adolescent is now able,

1042
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:59,160
the teen really is able to now sample many, many more extra receptive events through behavior.

1043
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,800
So some of these recommendations are interesting.

1044
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:03,510
The theory is that

1045
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:08,070
one of the motivations is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition.

1046
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,180
As teenagers get older, they start questioning whether or not their parents

1047
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:16,620
are everything they thought they were whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was,

1048
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,870
or the worst thing that ever was, perhaps,

1049
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,340
including whether or not they will be able to provide them resources.

1050
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,420
So they test whether or not

1051
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:28,320
they can actually feed themselves whether or not they can support themselves,

1052
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:30,420
although rarely not.

1053
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:32,520
Certainly, it happens.

1054
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,370
But rarely Are they really taking care of themselves,

1055
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:38,040
although some teens are forced to take care of themselves, of course,

1056
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:40,650
because parents and other caretakers aren't available.

1057
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:45,180
The recommendations that map to the biology include later,

1058
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,080
there's been a big push for later start times in schools to match their

1059
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,990
shifts in circadian rhythms and the need for extended sleep,

1060
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,910
something we talked about during the sleep episodes.

1061
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:02,880
To insist on sleep interventions for youth who are at increased risk for mental health problems,

1062
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:07,290
almost every mental health issue is supported by getting

1063
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,440
regular quality sleep of sufficient duration,

1064
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,510
sufficient duration is going to vary from person to person.

1065
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:18,240
Leveraging different kinds of social relationships that reinforce positive behavior.

1066
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,060
This is starting to sound like kind of a boilerplate stuff.

1067
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:26,190
And yet, really, the goal is during puberty to encourage as many they

1068
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:32,040
say forms of interaction that allow children, teens, really an adolescence,

1069
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,260
I keep calling them children, but what I mean are people,

1070
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:39,150
children going through puberty that allow them to test this thing of autonomy,

1071
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,040
so that they can start to

1072
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:47,700
make good assessments about their extra receptive events that they are selecting,

1073
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,470
and how those make them feel internally.

1074
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:54,240
So they're essentially doing a buffet, the buffet has now broadened to not just include

1075
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:58,350
the events and experiences that their parents and other caretakers bring them.

1076
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:03,090
But they can now expand the buffet into things that they can provide themselves.

1077
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:08,040
And so adolescence, and puberty is really seen as the period of development

1078
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:13,560
in which one self samples for these two elements that we talked about at the beginning, which are,

1079
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:16,290
how do I form bonds?

1080
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,590
And how do I make predictions about what will make me feel good?

1081
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,050
At a level of interoception.

1082
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,810
Some of that might sound a little transactional,

1083
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,260
you know that all we're trying to do is figure out how we can

1084
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,010
bond with people so we can get what we need so we can feel how we need.

1085
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:35,700
I think that's true to some extent, of course, there's a richer,

1086
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:42,060
more abstract aspect of relationships too, which are, you know, in relationships,

1087
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,060
you can access things you couldn't do before you can cooperate.

1088
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:47,550
There's things like teamwork, you can do all sorts of things.

1089
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,900
But in terms of the biology, it's clear that there's this stage of development,

1090
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,090
where more autonomy,

1091
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,500
more physical capability is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain.

1092
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:02,610
And these peptide chain In the brain and body, and that,

1093
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,590
nonetheless brings us back to the exact same model that we started with an infancy

1094
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,330
of alert or calm, feel good, or feel bad.

1095
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,860
Primarily extra cepting, primarily interoceptive.

1096
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,340
So I keep going back to this, I'm sort of like a repeating record on that.

1097
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:26,460
Because the same core algorithm, the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.

1098
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:29,130
And that's a useful framework, in my opinion,

1099
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:33,990
because it allows you to sort through all the data and information that's out there about well,

1100
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:38,550
this area, the stria, terminalis is active or the basal lateral amygdala is active or gray matter,

1101
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:43,770
thickening, or this hormone or that hormone, and return to a kind of kernel of

1102
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:49,110
certainly not exhaustive truth that doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality, but at least

1103
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:54,120
establishes some groundwork from which you can start to evaluate how different behaviors

1104
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:00,180
might or might not make sense how certain emotional responses might or might not make sense,

1105
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:05,250
regardless of the age of the person or the organism, a discussion about emotions

1106
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:11,400
would not be complete without talking about the right brain left brain stuff.

1107
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:18,900
And this is a very interesting aspect of sociology, psychology and neuroscience.

1108
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,870
There's a theory of emotional development that I find particularly interesting,

1109
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,010
which is from Allan schore.

1110
01:11:26,010 --> 01:11:30,840
At UCLA, he talks about how most of our testing of bonds and relationships

1111
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:34,920
is the seesaw back and forth between very dopaminergic.

1112
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,270
So driven by dopamine or serotonergic, driven by serotonin states.

1113
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,990
And this starts with infant and mother or infant and Father,

1114
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,290
I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode, but just to remind you,

1115
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,040
or for anyone that didn't hear about it, that during development,

1116
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,930
healthy emotional development clearly

1117
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:59,130
begins with an ability for the caretaker and child to be in calm, peaceful, soothing,

1118
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:05,100
touch oriented, I gazing type of behaviors, those really drive serotonin,

1119
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,840
the endogenous opioid system.

1120
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,310
Oxytocin, things are very calming, and

1121
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,730
are centered around pleasure with the here and now as well as

1122
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,100
excited states of what we're going to do next,

1123
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:22,110
there's actually a kind of characteristic sign of the dopaminergic interaction,

1124
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:28,830
where both caretaker and child how are wide eyed, the pupils dilate that signature of arousal,

1125
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:31,410
they get really excited, oftentimes, the baby will look away,

1126
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:35,190
if it gets really excited that those are signatures of dopamine release in the body.

1127
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,740
And in adolescence, these same things carry forward where they're good bonds are

1128
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,870
achieved through hanging around watching TV just kind of being there,

1129
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:47,700
you know, playing video games or

1130
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,190
texting together or talking whatever it is that the soothing local activity happens to be,

1131
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:56,070
as well as adventure and things that are exciting.

1132
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:59,850
So it could be sports, it could be shopping, it could be summer adventure,

1133
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:01,680
it could be the next big thing.

1134
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:06,510
And so this kind of seesaw back and forth between their different reward systems seems to be

1135
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:10,800
the basis from which healthy emotional bonds are created.

1136
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,150
And I invite anyone who's interested in this to look up some of Dr.

1137
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,990
Shores work.

1138
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,660
I think I misspoke on the last episode.

1139
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,590
He's not a psychiatrist.

1140
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:24,180
He's a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst, but has deep routings in neuroscience.

1141
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,910
So it's, I think, a fascinating aspect.

1142
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:31,200
But the way it's framed in that book, and in his book,

1143
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,350
and in some of the language around that is a round right brain left brain.

1144
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:39,180
And we've all heard this stuff before that the right brain is thought to be the emotional side.

1145
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,710
This is the characteristic thing that you hear out there, that the right brain is holistic,

1146
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:48,180
that it's emotive and that the left brain is logical, sequential and analytic.

1147
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,870
And that's not what Shor was proposing.

1148
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,480
There are some right brain left brain differences.

1149
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,520
But the idea that the right brain is synthetic, holistic and emotive,

1150
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:04,170
and that the left brain is logical, sequential and analytic is false.

1151
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:08,130
There is zero neuroscience evidence for that whatsoever.

1152
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:09,990
We're going to

1153
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:14,400
address this in more detail during a month talking about learning and memory and dementia.

1154
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,890
But let's talk about some truths.

1155
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,030
Some differences between the

1156
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:21,600
left brain and right brain because we can't have a discussion about emotion without doing that.

1157
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:28,890
The left brain, at least for people who are right handed, is linguistically dominant,

1158
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:33,360
meaning most of language is centered in the left side of the brain.

1159
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,550
For right handed people.

1160
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:42,090
If you were a left hander and you were forced to become right handed, chances are,

1161
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:46,950
this is still true because of when language gets laid down in the brain.

1162
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:52,860
For left handers, people that people that naturally write with their left hand and always did,

1163
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:56,880
language is still mostly in the left side of the brain.

1164
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:04,380
But it's also found More often in the right side of the brain, so it's not as lateralized.

1165
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,420
As we say it's kind of distributed between both.

1166
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:10,200
Okay, so right handers, most of your language is coming from the left side of your brain.

1167
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:13,710
Left handers, it's probably a little bit more evenly distributed.

1168
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:17,670
And there are some variations, whether or not you're a hook, righty, or a hook, lefty.

1169
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:19,260
There's all sorts of nuance to this.

1170
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,390
But that's the general aspect.

1171
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,930
So language tends to be centered in the left side of the brain.

1172
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,730
And that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax, all of it, except for one.

1173
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:33,810
And we'll talk about one aspect of language that seems to be more right brain,

1174
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,040
that's very interesting.

1175
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,690
There does seem to be some arithmetic advantage.

1176
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:43,260
So ability in math in the left side of the brain,

1177
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:45,810
and I'm going to talk about how all this was discovered in a minute.

1178
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,000
And the right brain, however, is linguistically primitive.

1179
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:54,780
Most people don't realize this, because the right brain is always described as the emotive side.

1180
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,670
It's super emotional and holistic.

1181
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:59,160
But it's actually linguistically primitive.

1182
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:02,580
And there's a way that that that's been teased out, through experiment.

1183
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,910
It's very good at manipulating spatial things and visual spatial tasks.

1184
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,830
It's primarily handling that stuff.

1185
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:14,520
But it's sort of non language, except one aspect.

1186
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,050
And there isn't a ton of evidence for this, but the evidence is strong, which is prosody.

1187
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:23,820
Prosody is the lilting and falling of language.

1188
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:27,870
So a good example would be Italian, I don't speak Italian.

1189
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,310
I only know a little bit of Italian.

1190
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:35,160
But they must be Italian I know is when my Italian colleagues have said to me my cousin Ichi,

1191
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,570
which means like, What are you trying to say?

1192
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:38,910
Or What are you saying, I think I'm getting that right.

1193
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:41,220
Basically, they're saying I don't speak Italian, which is true,

1194
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:44,700
or because one of them knows and loves Costello very much.

1195
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:51,210
They always say mp grani, which means big lazy guy, which accurately captures Costello.

1196
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:57,120
So even those few examples, right, Miko said he won't be good on it.

1197
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:01,200
There's a lot of lilt and fall in Italian other languages not so much.

1198
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,460
And it varies by language.

1199
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,670
One of the reasons I find Italian, so beautiful, not the Italian I speak,

1200
01:17:05,670 --> 01:17:10,230
but the Italian that other people speak, so beautiful to listen to is that that prosody,

1201
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:14,010
and the shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable.

1202
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:17,340
It's almost like a singing song, listening to them speak.

1203
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:19,020
And I used to like to go to scientific meetings.

1204
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:22,410
And I always hang out with the Italians because I had some good friends in Tallinn labs.

1205
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,420
But also because they always knew where the best food was,

1206
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,580
their standards for food are incredible.

1207
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,220
They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta,

1208
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,790
and the pasta they do find and that they're willing to eat as always fantastic.

1209
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,430
But in addition to that, they always brought a guitar,

1210
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:38,940
they were a lot more fun than a lot of my other colleagues to hang out with at meetings.

1211
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:40,320
So in any event,

1212
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:45,210
the right brain is doing things that are more about manipulating spatial information.

1213
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,370
And I'll talk about this more in a future episode.

1214
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:49,500
But this was discovered

1215
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,460
in Split brain patients and people that lack connection between the two sides of the brain.

1216
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,880
And it this had to be teased out through very complicated experiments.

1217
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,560
People like Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize for this was at Caltech, Mike khazanah,

1218
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,550
and others figured out these lateralized differences.

1219
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,980
But let's just try and demolish the myth that you know that the right side

1220
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,930
is synthetic and holistic and emotive and that the left side is logical, sequential and analytic,

1221
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:19,800
that you're a left brain person or a right brain person, nothing could be further from the truth,

1222
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,810
there's no scientific evidence to support that.

1223
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,970
And there's a few lesion studies

1224
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:27,450
that can tease out effects that make you think that's what's happening.

1225
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:30,810
But the really careful work points in a totally different direction.

1226
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,380
We can't have a complete conversation about emotions,

1227
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:38,100
and bonds and social connection without talking about oxytocin.

1228
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:43,830
Oxytocin has come to such prominence in the last decade or so, and seems to be everywhere.

1229
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:49,380
Anytime you hear a discussion about neuroscience in the brain, or hormones in the brain.

1230
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,090
Oxytocin is released in response to lactation.

1231
01:18:54,630 --> 01:19:00,240
In females, it is released in response to sexual interactions,

1232
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,320
it is released in response to non sexual touch.

1233
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:07,800
It's released in males and females.

1234
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:14,370
And indeed, it's involved in pair bonding and the establishment of social bonds in general.

1235
01:19:16,410 --> 01:19:21,210
How it does that seems to be by matching internal state,

1236
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:26,250
it seems to both increase synchrony of internal state somehow,

1237
01:19:26,850 --> 01:19:31,530
maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness that seems like a reasonable hypothesis,

1238
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:38,790
as well as raising people's awareness for the emotional state of their partner.

1239
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,590
And again, this brings us back to this alertness calmness axis

1240
01:19:43,890 --> 01:19:46,500
and this interoceptive extra receptive axis.

1241
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,110
In order form good bonds,

1242
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:54,810
we can't just be thinking about how we feel we also need to be paying attention to how others feel,

1243
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,210
and we're evaluating a match.

1244
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,790
We're trying to see whether or not there seems to be

1245
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,970
Some sort of synchrony between states and oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony

1246
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:10,320
and increase the awareness for the emotional state of others.

1247
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:16,620
Now, I know many of you are probably screaming mirror neurons mirror neurons, mirror neurons,

1248
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:19,140
as some of you may know, and some of you perhaps may not,

1249
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:25,620
are neurons that were discovered in animals and humans, for their ability to respond

1250
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,990
when people engage in certain physical actions like lifting of a pen,

1251
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:36,870
but the same neurons would respond when somebody watched someone else lift a pen.

1252
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:44,760
So they were really mirrors of or representing mirrors of behavior, both in self and in others.

1253
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,810
Mirror neurons are very controversial.

1254
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,160
There are many neuroscientists who I respect a lot who don't think they exist,

1255
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:56,580
because they look at the data and the data,

1256
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:01,230
at least in their mind were over interpreted in the realm of empathy,

1257
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,040
and in assigning value to the emotional states of others.

1258
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:10,200
And when I look at the literature, my opinion is that, indeed,

1259
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:15,150
there are neurons in the brain that clearly represent the actions of others.

1260
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:19,470
But it's not clear that they're wired into the emotion and empathy system in any direct way.

1261
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:26,520
And I think the growing consensus is that mirror neurons, while the name is terrific, is so catchy,

1262
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,910
and encompasses so much of what you would love for it to encompass,

1263
01:21:29,910 --> 01:21:32,100
but that the data don't really support that.

1264
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,120
But this is controversial.

1265
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,190
And I'm perfectly happy to get experts on here that could debate it better than I could.

1266
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:44,580
There are, however, neurons in the brain that were discovered by my colleague, Karen Hirsch,

1267
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:54,150
at Stanford, when she was working in gnomes lives lab that clearly point to the fact that

1268
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,360
primate species are

1269
01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:03,750
making assumptions and are trying to predict the behavior of other members of their species.

1270
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,620
It's an experiment, I don't have time to go into in real detail, which by just get Karen on here.

1271
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:10,230
For those of you that are familiar with the prisoner's dilemma,

1272
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:15,480
which is really a model of cooperation, you can either cooperate or one,

1273
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:19,770
one member of a given interaction can cooperate and the other one won't.

1274
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,820
Or you can, you can both not cooperate, there are ways in which

1275
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:29,130
you can solve the so called Prisoner's Dilemma by looking at previous behavior and making

1276
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:35,490
predictions about the likely next behavior that the other individual will engage in.

1277
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:40,470
And there do seem to be neurons that are doing these sorts of predictions or computations.

1278
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,400
And, again, I'll go into this in more detail in the future.

1279
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:49,290
So rather than think about mirror neurons, like neurons for empathy, I think it's more

1280
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,210
correct to think about neurons that are trying to predict the behavior of others.

1281
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:59,640
And that's, as we said, one of the core features of emotions which are to make

1282
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,870
to establish bonds and through those bonds to be able to predict behavior.

1283
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,880
So oxytocin is one component of this ability to predict

1284
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:11,430
others behavior and to guide our own behavior.

1285
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:17,430
So here are some experiments that involve the administration of intranasal oxytocin.

1286
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:21,600
This is actually people now I think you need a prescription, although in some places you don't,

1287
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:22,920
there are people who are taking

1288
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,910
intranasal oxytocin in order to try and increase the depth of bonding.

1289
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,580
And I don't recommend you do that.

1290
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:34,830
I've never tried that I whatever oxytocin I've released I've made without the an intranasal

1291
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,390
exogenous application.

1292
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:42,990
But what's been reported is increased positive communication among couples.

1293
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,530
So people have taken intranasal oxytocin in study.

1294
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:50,460
So that study just if you, for those of you like was published in biological psychiatry,

1295
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:55,410
which my psychiatry colleagues told me is a fine journal, and the title is intranasal.

1296
01:23:55,410 --> 01:24:00,180
Oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels

1297
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,680
during couple conflict.

1298
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,830
They have them fight or they have them fight without, with and without oxytocin.

1299
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,640
So interesting.

1300
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:13,230
I'm very much in line with the idea that oxytocin is the quote unquote,

1301
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:18,480
trust hormone that's in keeping with that, that was a 2009 paper.

1302
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:21,180
There's other evidence, for instance,

1303
01:24:21,210 --> 01:24:26,910
that men report a greater sense of connection and intimacy with their partners during sex.

1304
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:32,640
After taking intranasal oxytocin, there are studies in autistic children,

1305
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,360
giving them intranasal oxytocin as a way to try and help them

1306
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:42,810
establish better social connection and, quote unquote, empathy or theory of mind.

1307
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:44,310
I've talked about theory of mind before,

1308
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:50,190
we're understanding of what other children or end adults are experiencing.

1309
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:54,240
So, you know, oxytocin does seem to create these general effects

1310
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:58,830
and how nuanced they are in one situation or another.

1311
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:59,460
I don't know.

1312
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:03,210
I I'm aware and I was told and I'm definitely not recommending this that

1313
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:07,350
there's a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.

1314
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:10,620
Now, I have no idea maybe someone can put in the comments

1315
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,710
why you would want to combine oxytocin and ketamine.

1316
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:20,040
I can't imagine why ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that's used for the treatment of PTSD

1317
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,470
used to be used as a recreational drug.

1318
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:27,060
It's very similar to PCP seems quite dangerous.

1319
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:34,440
In fact, I don't know why those two things would be combined, why one would want to combine them.

1320
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:38,580
But there are products out there that seemed to combine those two things.

1321
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:41,580
And I'm not certain why one would do that.

1322
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,490
But it's interesting to note that it's happening.

1323
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,850
A particularly interesting study about oxytocin is that

1324
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,580
that was published in the Journal of Neuroscience, which is a good journal,

1325
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:56,190
that oxytocin modulates social distance between males and females.

1326
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,360
So there's interesting,

1327
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:03,480
what they did is they gave oxytocin to people that were in monogamous relationships,

1328
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:07,110
and then they evaluated the extent to which that in this case,

1329
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:11,160
the males in those relationships would pay attention to visual attention to

1330
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:14,100
attractive other potential partners.

1331
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:17,220
And it seemed like that the general takeaway from this study is that

1332
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:20,730
oxytocin administration seemed to promote monogamous behavior.

1333
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,420
So behavior that was in line with monogamy of the relationship that they were in,

1334
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:27,870
as opposed to foraging for potentially new mates.

1335
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,590
Now, of course, these are somewhat artificial experiments are very artificial experiments,

1336
01:26:31,590 --> 01:26:33,090
depending on how you interpret them.

1337
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:41,490
But the general theme is that oxytocin is promoting monogamy it's promoting pair bonding,

1338
01:26:41,490 --> 01:26:46,590
it's promoting a understanding of the internal state of others,

1339
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:50,880
which requires enhanced extra reception for those particular others.

1340
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,230
So not just generally having them look everywhere and see what's going on in the world,

1341
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:59,130
but particularly paying attention to the emotional states of others.

1342
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:03,150
I'm sure several of you will be asking, Well, what can I do to increase oxytocin?

1343
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:06,630
If that's your goal, there's some evidence and I invite you again,

1344
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:12,360
to go to examine calm or another such site like PubMed if you want to forage PubMed,

1345
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:17,160
that vitamin D is required for proper production, and in some cases,

1346
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:21,420
can increase levels of oxytocin when supplemented, which is interesting.

1347
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,930
And that, believe it or not melatonin, or old friend melatonin,

1348
01:27:24,930 --> 01:27:30,270
which I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep because of some of the

1349
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:35,220
what I view as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases.

1350
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:38,610
But it seems like melatonin, in some cases can,

1351
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:46,290
can prime the system for slightly increased oxytocin release, there's even one report, although

1352
01:27:46,710 --> 01:27:51,810
it didn't look that strong to me that low doses of caffeine could increase oxytocin release,

1353
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:57,840
but that, to me falls under the category of what was once described as a drug,

1354
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:02,640
when injected into a person or animal is always effective at producing a scientific paper,

1355
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:06,180
meaning that you can get a result but the result isn't always so robust.

1356
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:09,900
So you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts and get into the meat of the paper.

1357
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:14,550
And when I did that, the effects were were pretty negligible with caffeine on oxytocin.

1358
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:15,990
But it's interesting that vitamin D,

1359
01:28:16,170 --> 01:28:19,380
and melatonin may have some positive effects on oxytocin release.

1360
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:24,720
But like I said, many people are just taking oxytocin directly through these intra nasal sprays.

1361
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:28,620
I'm pretty sure it's prescription in most places, but but check and again,

1362
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:30,240
I'm not recommending anybody do that.

1363
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:32,280
I've never tried it. I don't know they will.

1364
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,800
I think I'm going to stick with the oxytocin that I've got.

1365
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:40,050
The other molecule that we make that's extremely important for social bonds and emotionality

1366
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:43,110
is one that we're going to talk about more in the month on hormones.

1367
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,820
But that's vasopressin.

1368
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:48,540
Vasopressin suppresses urination.

1369
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:49,800
It was actually developed.

1370
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:51,630
It's made by the body,

1371
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:55,830
but it's It was developed as a treatment for something called diabetes insipidus,

1372
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,810
where people urinate excessively,

1373
01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:01,830
and they actually risk dehydration and they can lose a lot of electrolytes, etc.

1374
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,600
So it causes water retention.

1375
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,930
Alcohol consumption, inhibits vasopressin,

1376
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,460
so large amounts of alcohol made people excrete a lot of fluid, and so forth.

1377
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,910
These depressant has effects on the brain directly.

1378
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,480
It actually creates feelings of giddy love.

1379
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:22,680
It also increases memory with in very potent ways.

1380
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:28,620
There's a whole biohacking community that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time.

1381
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,140
I have never tried it, I certainly don't recommend it,

1382
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:36,300
it is prescription and it is a pretty serious compound to start,

1383
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:41,640
you know, messing with because it has so many different effects in the body.

1384
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,990
It's it's interesting because it creates the sense of giddy love.

1385
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:49,830
It's, it's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac.

1386
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:51,810
So it's similar to oxytocin.

1387
01:29:52,380 --> 01:29:56,880
It also has very interesting effects on monogamous or non monogamous behavior.

1388
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,690
This again, we will revisit in the future but there's A

1389
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:03,510
beautiful set of experiments that have been done in a little

1390
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:05,760
rodent species called a prairie vole.

1391
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,090
It turns out they're two different populations of prairie voles, some are monogamous,

1392
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,150
they always mate with the same other prairie vole,

1393
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:18,600
and some are very robustly non monogamous they mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.

1394
01:30:18,810 --> 01:30:22,500
And turns out that levels of vasopressin and or vasopressin receptor

1395
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,840
dictate whether or not they're monogamous or not.

1396
01:30:24,930 --> 01:30:27,300
There's actually some interesting evidence in humans.

1397
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,170
When when people report their behavior, assuming they're reporting accurately,

1398
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:37,410
that vasopressin vasopressin levels can relate to monogamy, or non monogamy in humans as well.

1399
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:40,170
We're going to talk about this in the month on hormones.

1400
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,610
If we're talking about the neuroscience of emotions, we have to talk about the Vegas nerve.

1401
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,970
I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode.

1402
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:53,070
That's these connections between the body and the viscera, including the gut, the heart, the lungs,

1403
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:57,450
and the immune system, and the brain and that the brain is also controlling these organs.

1404
01:30:57,510 --> 01:30:58,860
So it's a two way street.

1405
01:30:59,790 --> 01:31:02,280
There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before,

1406
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:07,020
that stimulating the Vegas in various ways, leads to calmness,

1407
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,760
that it's always going to calm you down.

1408
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,500
And that is false.

1409
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:12,390
I just want to repeat that is completely false.

1410
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:17,160
In fact, there was just a paper, yet another paper published the other day, which is fantastic,

1411
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,860
which is from David McCormick's lab of the University of Oregon.

1412
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:24,990
It's published in Current Biology, excellent journal, showing, I'm just reading the title.

1413
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:28,650
Vegas nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical,

1414
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:31,320
the neocortex and behavioral activation.

1415
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:33,150
I've read the paper, it's fantastic.

1416
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:39,180
It illustrates yet again, stimulation of the Vegas increases dopamine release increases

1417
01:31:39,630 --> 01:31:42,030
activation of the brain alertness.

1418
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:47,880
It is a stimulant of alertness, it is not calming people down.

1419
01:31:48,270 --> 01:31:55,620
Now this is interesting in light of emotionality because of work that's been done by many groups,

1420
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:59,820
but in particular, I'm going to focus on the work of a colleague of mine, Karl deisseroth,

1421
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:05,250
at Stanford, who's a psychiatrist but has also developed a lot of tools to adjust

1422
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:09,750
the activity of neurons in real time using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.

1423
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:14,190
I'll refer you to an article in The New Yorker that was published about this a few years ago,

1424
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:18,330
I'm going to read a brief excerpt at I'll put the the link in the caption as well.

1425
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:23,250
He's talking to an extremely depressed suicidally depressed patient

1426
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:29,040
who has a small device implanted that allows her to adjust her Vegas nerve activity.

1427
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:33,060
Now, Vegas stimulation was originally developed for the treatment of epilepsy,

1428
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:35,940
it's now being used for various other purposes.

1429
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:40,740
Vegas stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems.

1430
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,550
So again, increasing activity of the Vegas increases alertness.

1431
01:32:44,910 --> 01:32:46,470
And it's just incredible

1432
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:50,970
to see what happens in real time to emotionality when the Vegas is stimulated.

1433
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:54,180
Again, not calming, but activating alertness.

1434
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:59,370
They're in his office and they're talking and he asks her how she's doing.

1435
01:32:59,370 --> 01:33:05,550
And she, she describes how she has been doing as previously as quote, unquote, going pancake,

1436
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:07,830
which for her just means totally laid out flat.

1437
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,900
Not much going on.

1438
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:13,020
She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job.

1439
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:14,520
She's really depressed.

1440
01:33:15,450 --> 01:33:20,280
And he says in, you know, typical good psychiatry fashion, you know, well, that's a lot to think about.

1441
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,180
That's actually the quote.

1442
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:26,100
And they talked about her blood pressure, etc.

1443
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:32,490
And then she says, you know, moods been down, just spiraling down talks about insomnia, bad dreams,

1444
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:33,360
low appetite.

1445
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,790
So this is severe depression.

1446
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:37,260
This is what we call major depression.

1447
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:43,080
And then she requests can we please go up to 1.5 on Vegas stimulation,

1448
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:48,360
she had been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation every five minutes to 30 seconds,

1449
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,550
but was no longer able to feel the effects.

1450
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:56,490
So he says, Okay, I think we can go up a little you're tolerating things well, they start,

1451
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,250
skip the stimulation, and, quote, in the course of the next few minutes,

1452
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:07,230
her name was Sally underwent a remarkable change, her frown disappeared, she became cheerful,

1453
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,370
describing the pleasure

1454
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:11,430
she'd had during the Christmas holiday and recounting how she'd recently watched some

1455
01:34:11,670 --> 01:34:13,200
YouTube videos of dice are hot.

1456
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:17,310
She was still smiling and talking when the session ended,

1457
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:19,230
and they walked out to the reception area.

1458
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:23,190
So this is just by stimulating and activating the Vegas Now why am I bringing this up?

1459
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,380
Well, for several reasons.

1460
01:34:25,380 --> 01:34:30,660
One is the Vegas is fascinating in terms of the brain body connection to I'd like to

1461
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,940
keep trying to dispel the myth that Vegas stimulation is all about being calm.

1462
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,110
It's really about being alert.

1463
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:41,880
I don't know how that originally got going backwards, but it's about being alert.

1464
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:47,610
And once again, level of alertness or level of calmness is impacting emotion,

1465
01:34:47,790 --> 01:34:54,180
that this access of alertness and calmness is one primary axis in emotion.

1466
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:58,980
It's not the only one because there's also this valence component of good or bad and it's

1467
01:34:59,070 --> 01:34:59,970
those two aren't the

1468
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:03,330
Only once because there's also this component of interoceptive exteroceptive,

1469
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:04,170
that we talked about earlier.

1470
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:05,610
And there will be others too.

1471
01:35:05,670 --> 01:35:06,990
Again, it's not exhaustive.

1472
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,460
But I find it fascinating.

1473
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,380
And it really brings us back to where we started, which is, what are the core elements of emotion?

1474
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:14,790
And what can you do about them.

1475
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:20,340
And before we close up today, I just want to make sure that even though I've mentioned some tools,

1476
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,670
I talked about the the mood meter app, I talked about

1477
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,390
oxytocin and some of the things that impact oxytocin

1478
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:31,740
and talked about some of the ways that you can conceptualize emotions.

1479
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:36,480
This business of how you conceptualize emotions is really the most powerful tool

1480
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:41,400
you can ever have, in terms of understanding and regulating your emotional state,

1481
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:46,410
if you're willing to try and wrap your head around it, I realize it's not the simplest thing to do.

1482
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:52,200
But rather than think of emotions, as just these labels, happy, sad or depressed,

1483
01:35:52,500 --> 01:36:00,420
thinking them thinking about emotions, excuse me, as elements of the brain and body,

1484
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:05,550
that encompass levels of alertness that include a dynamic with the outside world,

1485
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,410
and your perception of your internal state.

1486
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:11,520
And starting to really think about emotions in a structured way,

1487
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:16,350
can not only allow you to understand some of the pathology of when you know,

1488
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:19,500
you might feel depressed or anxious or others are depressed and anxious,

1489
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:23,580
but also to develop a richer, emotional experience to anything.

1490
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:27,600
Now, of course, I don't expect that as you're out there, interacting with friends,

1491
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:31,020
and you're watching TV and experiencing life that you should be parsing every bit

1492
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:36,030
of your experience in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way, that's not the goal here.

1493
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:40,950
But for those of you that are practitioners, teachers of any kind, for those of you that are kids,

1494
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:42,510
for those of you that are

1495
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:47,130
trying to understand what your emotional life and your consciousness there, I say the word

1496
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:52,110
really consists of, I do believe that these are fundamental elements

1497
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:56,850
that are well supported by the science across a variety of researchers doing

1498
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,790
your things from a variety of different perspectives,

1499
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:02,580
and some of whom agree with one another and some of whom don't.

1500
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:06,900
So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge

1501
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:12,090
from which you can start to think about your emotional life differently, I hope,

1502
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:16,260
as well as others in a way that builds more richness into that experience.

1503
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:17,820
Not that detracts from it.

1504
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:22,650
One last point as it relates to that many of you have asked me

1505
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:27,780
about psychedelic therapies that are now emerging things like silicides, and MDMA.

1506
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:32,280
We are, of course, going to dive into that topic deeply.

1507
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,400
We have an expert guests coming on to discuss that topic.

1508
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:43,020
Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality that we were talking about today.

1509
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:50,310
Calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad interoceptive extra receptive positioning.

1510
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:56,220
And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration of those compounds,

1511
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:00,930
and what the therapeutic and scientific community is thinking about them, and how they function,

1512
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:05,130
I think it's more important to embed that framework in our thinking,

1513
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:09,330
so that when we address psychedelics, and we address other sorts of therapies,

1514
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:10,800
cognitive behavioral therapy,

1515
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:15,810
different types of emotive therapies that relate to individuals and couples, etc,

1516
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:20,880
that we are able to think about them with some sort of structure and rigor,

1517
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:26,130
rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals that produce these amazing experiences

1518
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,110
that people need to tell you about.

1519
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:32,040
Because if there's one truth, it seems that psychedelics seem to promote

1520
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:35,220
activity of storytelling about psychedelic experience,

1521
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:39,090
but that itself is not really what the therapeutic community and the

1522
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,580
academic and communities are interested in.

1523
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:45,480
They're interested in trying to understand the universal truths,

1524
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,590
the universal biological shifts and psychological shifts that occur

1525
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,810
in the clinical use of those compounds.

1526
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,570
And so we're going to hold off for now, but we will get to them.

1527
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:57,750
Once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material today,

1528
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,870
it's really the equivalent of two if not three University lectures.

1529
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:02,760
In one podcast episode,

1530
01:39:03,570 --> 01:39:07,230
I want to thank those of you that have supported the podcast and point to ways in which

1531
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:09,210
all of you can support the podcast.

1532
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,190
Many of these are cost free.

1533
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:13,590
The first is to please subscribe on YouTube.

1534
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:18,930
And as well to hit the notifications button so that when we release new videos,

1535
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,870
which typically is every Monday for the full length episodes,

1536
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:24,930
but we also know how short clips that you'll be notified.

1537
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,310
As well.

1538
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:29,160
If you could subscribe on Apple, and Spotify.

1539
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:33,780
And leave us a review on Apple, you have the opportunity to leave us a five star review.

1540
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,490
If you think we deserve a five star review.

1541
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:40,230
Please tell your friends and family and co workers about the podcast if you think the material

1542
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,960
would be of interest and informative for them.

1543
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,900
And if you want to send them links, that's terrific too.

1544
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,300
We also have a Patreon account.

1545
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:54,330
It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman and there you can support us at any level that you like.

1546
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:57,390
In addition, if you could check out our sponsors,

1547
01:39:57,390 --> 01:40:00,000
we always provide links to those sponsors in the chat.

1548
01:40:00,990 --> 01:40:03,030
That's the best way to support the podcast.

1549
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:06,000
And several of you have asked about supplements.

1550
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:08,340
I talked about supplements in various episodes.

1551
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:13,770
We've partnered with Thorne, because we think Thorin has the very highest levels of stringency,

1552
01:40:13,980 --> 01:40:18,000
in terms of the purity of the contents, and the amounts of the contents,

1553
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,640
they really put in the bottle what's listed on the bottom,

1554
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:23,010
which is not true for a lot of supplement companies.

1555
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:25,350
If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1556
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:29,340
as well as get a discount on those or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes,

1557
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:36,840
you can go to thorne.com slash you slash Huberman and you can get 20% off any of those supplements,

1558
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,090
or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

1559
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:43,350
So that's Thorne, t h o r n e.com.

1560
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:50,070
Slash the letter U slash Huberman to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne makes?

1561
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:54,630
And last but certainly not least, I want to thank you for your time and attention.

1562
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,030
And thank you for your interest in science.
