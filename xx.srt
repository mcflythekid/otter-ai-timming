1
00:00:02,070  -->  00:00:12,870
You got to be prepared. And you got to recognize too, that it's not personal. She's not trying to shit on you. She's not trying to be nasty to you.

2
00:00:13,230  -->  00:00:25,710
On the contrary, a girl will only give a shit test to a guy that she is seriously considering. She won't waste her time with a guy that she does not take seriously.

3
00:00:26,100  -->  00:00:35,160
Yeah, I should test when you start getting shit tests from the girl, it means that you're on track with the girl, okay? And that's why you have to prepare this shit.

4
00:00:36,300  -->  00:00:49,860
Don't think that you can just laugh it off some shit tests these shit tests, they're very, very serious. Because see, a girl will never really want you until you have passed the shit tests that she puts on you.

5
00:00:50,130  -->  00:01:11,010
Okay, so understand how crucial they are. But don't freak out about it. The way you have to handle them is with humor. What are shit tests? I mean,

6
00:01:11,010  -->  00:01:21,300
this is a reasonable question. And men get hit by shit tests from women all the time. So the question what are shit tests is simply put,

7
00:01:21,480  -->  00:01:34,440
they are compliance tests, they are tests to make sure that the item in question is up to spec. Let me explain z A lot of times a woman will shit test a guy.

8
00:01:34,470  -->  00:01:47,940
Now what does that mean? That's a colloquialism from game shit test, right. And what it means is that basically a woman will say something to a guy who that will put him like off balance,

9
00:01:48,030  -->  00:01:59,250
she will poke at him to see if he is as manly and assured and confident as he is projecting himself to be. You say, I mean, like,

10
00:01:59,250  -->  00:02:07,050
for instance, with a product testing a compliance test of a product, you you take some products, I don't know your man manufacturing some widget,

11
00:02:07,080  -->  00:02:14,880
right? And you take that product and you you start taking it apart and trying to break it to see if it is up to standard, you know,

12
00:02:15,120  -->  00:02:22,770
if it breaks very easily, then clearly it fails the compliance test and the product is no good. But if it breaks, but it's actually very hard to break it,

13
00:02:22,830  -->  00:02:29,370
it requires X amount of force, I mean, who knows a ton of force or whatever, for the widget to break, then you say, Oh, it's in compliance,

14
00:02:29,370  -->  00:02:41,040
it's within the parameters, right? That's what a woman is doing with a guy when she should test she is trying to ensure that the confidence that he is projecting is actual and not a lie.

15
00:02:41,100  -->  00:02:50,880
Because you see, it's very easy for a guy to pretend to be something that he isn't, okay. You see a guy like at, you know, some club and he's dressed really nicely,

16
00:02:50,970  -->  00:03:00,390
right? And he's like, very well groomed and maybe has like, I don't know, like a gold chain or some shit like that. Right? And so what is he projecting he is projecting out in the world out into the world,

17
00:03:00,810  -->  00:03:12,630
projecting to women that he has a good income that he you know, has resources. And you know, the the gold chain and the nice expensive flashy clothes.

18
00:03:12,630  -->  00:03:21,570
They're all to make sure that people know that he has resources right there a signal, okay? He's not flashing around like a wad of bills,

19
00:03:21,570  -->  00:03:30,630
but the clothes are basically acting the same way. Right? And so what will a girl do to to see if he's for real? She'll shit test him.

20
00:03:30,930  -->  00:03:37,020
And she'll say, Oh, well, what are you driving? And if the guy sort of like Wilson says, you know, something like, Oh, well,

21
00:03:37,020  -->  00:03:45,720
I came on the bus. Then she realizes that the facade you know, the expensive clothes, the potential jewelry, which I find just absurd,

22
00:03:45,720  -->  00:03:53,670
but whatever. Or whatever the fuck, that is all a facade. That's what you'll realize. If you came on a bus, it means that you didn't have a pot to piss in,

23
00:03:53,700  -->  00:04:01,290
right? If he came in a limo with his own driver, you know, and his actual driver, not like a hired limo, but like, you know,

24
00:04:01,680  -->  00:04:10,560
a limo driver that works for him. 24 seven, then she'll be like, Oh, you know, he's the real deal. But you see the problem that girl has seen.

25
00:04:10,830  -->  00:04:23,730
She wants to make sure that the guy she meets who is projecting a certain image is actually that thing you see, because a guy what's the guy looking for in a woman? A hot woman? That's all he cares about.

26
00:04:23,760  -->  00:04:34,620
Right? She could be dumb as a brick, right? And totally poor. I mean, popper poor, right? It does not matter because what does a guy want in a woman? She wants her to be hot.

27
00:04:34,980  -->  00:04:43,350
If she's sexually attractive, she could be an idiot and poor and he won't mind. Yeah, I mean, come on. Yeah, really, you know,

28
00:04:43,500  -->  00:04:50,610
now of course, because because from an evolutionary perspective, we are pushed towards selecting mates who are attractive,

29
00:04:50,820  -->  00:05:00,540
who are physically attractive, because that will mean that if she is physically attractive, and she has long hair and other certain signs of long term health You know,

30
00:05:00,540  -->  00:05:08,670
it will ensure to us that if we have children with her, these children will be healthy. They might be stupid, but they'll be healthy,

31
00:05:08,670  -->  00:05:18,120
at least you see, I'm saying, right. And so that's why we care about how good looking girl is. We care about, you know, skin without blemishes,

32
00:05:18,120  -->  00:05:23,430
you know, because if she has, like Bella wishes, it's probably because she's six, somehow, we care about her having long,

33
00:05:23,460  -->  00:05:29,940
long hair, because if she has long hair, well, it takes at least a couple of years to grow out hair. That's like shoulder length.

34
00:05:29,940  -->  00:05:38,730
Right? And that means that she has had long term health because, again, you know, certain many illnesses, right? damage a woman's hair,

35
00:05:38,730  -->  00:05:48,930
and it falls out. Okay? This is in the past no longer the case today, but you see what's going on? Just by looking at her, we can tell if she's sexually attractive or not.

36
00:05:49,620  -->  00:05:57,960
But that's not the case for women now, because what women are looking for in a man is social position, social dominance. That's what they're looking for.

37
00:05:58,170  -->  00:06:07,500
Okay? They are not looking for money. That's what stupid men think. And they are not looking for the guy who's the most attractive again,

38
00:06:07,500  -->  00:06:20,820
that's what stupid guys think. No, no, what they want is social position, a man with a high status, because a man with a high status means that any child she has with him will be protected.

39
00:06:20,970  -->  00:06:29,670
That's what she wants. That's what she wants, because it's been selected by evolution. Okay, this isn't going to change anytime soon,

40
00:06:29,700  -->  00:06:36,870
it will never change insofar as human beings are concerned, women will always be attracted to a man who has high social position.

41
00:06:37,350  -->  00:06:47,430
Okay. And so because of that they have to check. And that's why they should test. Because if that social position is not obvious to everybody,

42
00:06:47,730  -->  00:06:54,540
she will have to make sure that it's true that she will have to make sure that what the guy is projecting to her is real and not bullshit.

43
00:06:54,690  -->  00:07:01,590
Let me give you a simple example. Leonardo DiCaprio is a famous actor. He's won an Oscar. He's been in a bunch of very successful pictures,

44
00:07:01,590  -->  00:07:11,340
right? Okay, so you see him walking down the street, and there's wearing a baseball cap and a ratty old t shirt, right? Any girl who sees him? Right? What you're going to think is you're going to think that,

45
00:07:11,340  -->  00:07:19,230
oh, that guy is dressed really badly. No, she's gonna say, holy shit. That's the DiCaprio. He doesn't have to prove his social worth.

46
00:07:19,710  -->  00:07:27,300
Because he's the DiCaprio. Everybody knows who he is. He's a famous actor. He can go anywhere, you know, in private jets. And he's got a boatload of money because of his career,

47
00:07:27,330  -->  00:07:36,180
right? He doesn't have to prove anything. He doesn't have to project anything. He doesn't have to show off how rich he is. He doesn't have to wave around his Oscar.

48
00:07:36,330  -->  00:07:47,310
He doesn't have to do anything because everybody knows. Okay. His social position is the fact that he's at the very tippy top of the social hierarchy.

49
00:07:47,670  -->  00:07:57,840
Because he's Leo DiCaprio, because everybody knows who he is, right? So he doesn't have to do shit, insofar as proving to some girl is worth his social worth.

50
00:07:58,200  -->  00:08:14,880
Because he's Leo DiCaprio. And that's why, you know, he can go to you know, just a black tie event full of supermodels dressed in a ratty t shirt and shorts and flip flops and old baseball cap without having shaved for three days where everybody else is dressed to the nines.

51
00:08:14,880  -->  00:08:29,580
He just shows up, you know, Crick's a finger at the hottest thing there and that hottest thing there, she'll leave with him on the spot and go fuck his brains out the capital Ville or wherever the fuck instantly because he's the DiCaprio,

52
00:08:29,580  -->  00:08:47,910
he doesn't have to prove anything. But you do instead Why? Okay, most guys, the vast majority of guys, right? Because we live in the modernist society that we do we because we live in a society where who we are is not obvious because there is no social history among us.

53
00:08:48,060  -->  00:08:55,650
Because we're all floating independently, we are these floating atoms who collide against one another, right? And so a girl comes across you,

54
00:08:55,740  -->  00:09:07,560
she has no idea how successful you are. She has no idea of your position in your business or career. She has no idea. So she has to test you to make sure that you are who you claim to be,

55
00:09:07,980  -->  00:09:14,010
ergo shit tests. Now the funny thing is that a lot of guys were very successful with a lot of guys who've got a lot going for them,

56
00:09:14,040  -->  00:09:24,990
they fail miserably. Okay. Because you see in the past in the pre modern era, in a society in a mill you right, first of all,

57
00:09:24,990  -->  00:09:33,150
it was relatively small, you know, it would be between maybe 100 people and maybe 500 people and everybody sort of like knew everybody else,

58
00:09:33,330  -->  00:09:41,460
and everybody had connections to one another. So everybody had a fairly decent idea of who was who, right. That was in the past.

59
00:09:41,460  -->  00:09:50,580
I'm talking you know, at least 100 years ago or if not earlier, but all throughout history before that, okay. But now today in our current value,

60
00:09:50,610  -->  00:09:59,970
where we're all floating independent of one another, since there is no social track record, since a girl who meets you will have no idea who your parents are.

61
00:10:00,000  -->  00:10:08,970
Or who your clan is or who your tribe is or in shit like that. She will have no idea who you are. So she will have to figure out who you are.

62
00:10:09,450  -->  00:10:18,600
And as she figures out who you are by doing these shit tests to see if you are a confident individual to see if you are a man with actual resources,

63
00:10:18,600  -->  00:10:30,360
or you're just bullshitting to see if you are the man, she thinks you are. She's going to inflict shit tests on you. And it's not personal.

64
00:10:30,600  -->  00:10:43,830
Okay? It's not personal. But it has a very clear purpose. And the tragedy is that a lot of guys who've got a lot going for them fail these shit tests.

65
00:10:44,160  -->  00:10:51,210
They don't know how to handle them. Not only have I seen this in other guys, it's sometimes it's happened to me. Oh, yeah. I mean,

66
00:10:51,210  -->  00:10:58,470
more than once, you know, some girl would shit test me and I didn't know how to handle it. Sometimes I was caught off guard sometimes because the girl was very,

67
00:10:58,470  -->  00:11:05,790
very attractive. I was intimidated. I couldn't think of something on spot. Okay. Because I mean, like anybody any guy will tell you of course,

68
00:11:06,030  -->  00:11:15,390
is a lot of times you know, a very attractive girl will, her mere presence will rob you of like, the 15 to 25 IQ points for crying out loud.

69
00:11:15,390  -->  00:11:27,120
It's it's kind of pathetic, but it's the truth. You know? You come across some girl that's very attractive or whom you consider very attractive a lot of times you get all insecure nervous and you Bumble around like a fucking retard.

70
00:11:27,120  -->  00:11:51,570
But Wow, that's life. That's one of the problems but anyway, it's happened to me. It's happened to every guy. A girl will give you some shit test and you will fail it you will fail it even though you would have complied even though she was shit testing you to see if you were confident she was shit testing you to see if you were successful shit testing you for whatever fucking reason,

71
00:11:51,930  -->  00:12:03,690
you would have passed the shit test. But you got nervous. Yeah, it happens to every guy. no exception. And so don't worry about it.

72
00:12:03,720  -->  00:12:10,740
Yeah, don't worry about it. But by the same token, you know, don't learn to live with it. Okay. You know, I'm saying I mean, what I'm saying is basically,

73
00:12:11,100  -->  00:12:22,710
you got to learn to deal with shit tests. You got to learn how to handle a woman when she throws a shit test your way. And how do you learn to do it by fucking practice? Yeah,

74
00:12:22,710  -->  00:12:36,330
going out there. Yeah, the more times you are hit with a shit test, the better you will be at responding to it. Especially the more you understand what is going on,

75
00:12:37,170  -->  00:12:48,090
the better you will do with shit tests. The first step is to classify What the shit test is about a girl will shit test you to see if you have confidence as opposed to Ursa.

76
00:12:48,090  -->  00:12:56,550
It's confidence. She's going to shit test you to see if you have resources, she's going to shit test you to see if you have social connections and more importantly,

77
00:12:56,730  -->  00:13:07,890
if you're socially adroit if you're socially on the ball, okay, and she will shit test you to see if this is the trickiest one of them all.

78
00:13:07,920  -->  00:13:22,770
You see, she will shit test you to see if she is the best thing you've ever been with. Or if you've been with better. Yeah, let me start with this one guys compete for women.

79
00:13:22,770  -->  00:13:33,840
But of course, women compete for guys. Oh, yeah, they compete ruthlessly with one another, okay. And a woman is always looking for a guy who can attract a girl who is better than her.

80
00:13:34,320  -->  00:13:44,160
Okay. This happened to me a bunch of times over the years, you know, like, I wanted to date girl a. And she was like, say like an eight,

81
00:13:44,220  -->  00:13:51,960
right? And she didn't really want to date me or she wasn't really that interested. But then she spotted me dating a girl who was a nine or a 10.

82
00:13:51,960  -->  00:14:02,280
And automatically. I was fascinating to her. Yeah, yeah, girls always want to be dating a guy who can get the girl who's hotter than her.

83
00:14:02,880  -->  00:14:14,700
Okay. I mean, in the case of guys, because I know this, you know, a lot of times a guy will be relatively insecure about trying to date a girl who's dated a guy that they believe is a better than they are.

84
00:14:15,540  -->  00:14:28,980
He's going to feel insecure. And you know, it's not going to be an easy thing for the guy, right? But girls are they get off on trying to land the guy who has been with better women than them hotter women than them.

85
00:14:29,220  -->  00:14:36,540
Women always know who's the hottest girl, okay, they have their their sexual hierarchy very, very clear in their heads, okay.

86
00:14:37,140  -->  00:14:43,740
And so because of this because they are so clear as to you know, this is the hottest girl, this is the second hottest girl, the third,

87
00:14:43,740  -->  00:14:51,480
fourth, fifth, and they know exactly where they are in that hierarchy. When they know that you date a higher status girl than them,

88
00:14:51,780  -->  00:15:03,419
they want you more. Okay. And so a lot of times, they will try to suss out from you. What can Have a woman you usually date? You see? Yeah.

89
00:15:03,419  -->  00:15:09,899
And it'll be subtle. They'll ask you a little cues or what have you, and tried to figure out, you know, well, was he dating like,

90
00:15:10,049  -->  00:15:17,879
10? Or was he dating like an eight? Because maybe she's like a nine just for the sake of argument, right? And so if you were dating a 10,

91
00:15:17,879  -->  00:15:24,719
before, then she'll want to date you. But if she figures out that you were dating, like an eight or a seven, she's not going to give you the time of day.

92
00:15:24,749  -->  00:15:34,589
No way. Of course not. Because that's how women work. Okay? They want the better guy, the guy who dated the 10. And so if you dated a seven or six,

93
00:15:34,619  -->  00:15:44,789
fuck you, you're not going to get with that girl who's a nine. No way. Because she's not going to be wanting to be with a guy like that.

94
00:15:44,819  -->  00:15:51,209
It's as simple as that, you know, you will have failed the compliance test. You see, of course, if it's clear that you've dated the 10,

95
00:15:51,239  -->  00:16:01,529
then you have no problem. Okay? And what's funny is that see, a lot of times you date the girl who's a 10, okay? And they know for a fact that you dated the 10.

96
00:16:01,799  -->  00:16:08,819
And they're not going to give you any shit test at all. Okay? Because if they know for a fact that you dated this girl who was a 10,

97
00:16:09,179  -->  00:16:15,419
and you dated her, it doesn't matter if it was like a week or a month or a year, but you dated her, you're no longer with her.

98
00:16:15,539  -->  00:16:26,129
The girl who is a nine is going to be thrilled to be dating you and she's not going to give you any shit test. Yeah, because she's going to know that she is reaching for somebody higher.

99
00:16:26,189  -->  00:16:34,919
She's going to know for a fact, because she will assume that the girl who was a 10 already gave you shit tests. You see, see,

100
00:16:34,979  -->  00:16:45,449
see a girl who knows that you are with somebody else who is better. She assumes that you already went through all the hoops of a normal shit test because all girls give shit test to guys,

101
00:16:45,779  -->  00:16:54,449
all of them. So if you're like Leo DiCaprio, right, where everybody knows where you are on the totem pole. Leo DiCaprio has probably never had a shit test.

102
00:16:54,479  -->  00:17:01,169
Not as an adult. No way because everybody knows who he is. Right? So no girl in her right mind is going to shit test him. On the contrary,

103
00:17:01,169  -->  00:17:09,239
because he's such a high positions high status guy. Most girls are going to be fucking scared of him. Yeah, very scared of him.

104
00:17:09,719  -->  00:17:23,369
So if you really want to avoid shit tests, that's what you have to do. You have to create some sort of social proof. That is so obvious that no girl will dare to shit test you.

105
00:17:23,399  -->  00:17:31,289
This is of course, assuming that you're not good with shit tests, right? If you're not good with shit tests, then rather than try to get good at shit tests,

106
00:17:31,289  -->  00:17:43,289
you should have something that is so obvious, so untouchable that no girl in her right mind would dare to question it. And that's why so many guys get flashy cars.

107
00:17:43,319  -->  00:17:55,349
Yeah, because the flashy car like the Bentley or the Lamborghini or wherever the fuck whatever. vulgar piece of shit that they spent a boatload on automatically means that the guy's got means he's got a lot of money.

108
00:17:55,469  -->  00:18:02,009
Okay. And so a lot of times a lot of guys who are not very good with shit tests, what are they going to do? They're gonna get the expensive car,

109
00:18:02,039  -->  00:18:10,109
the really flashy car, the flashy car that is just like, you know, all bells and whistles, right? And that screams to everybody that he's got a shit ton of money.

110
00:18:10,199  -->  00:18:23,009
Yeah, that way. They avoid shit tests. But here's the thing. There are multiple shit tests, right? The lesser quality women are interested in the money shit test.

111
00:18:23,279  -->  00:18:34,199
Right? The higher quality women are interested in the brains shit test and the social proof shit test. Yeah. And see, that's why you know,

112
00:18:34,199  -->  00:18:44,009
you see a lot of these guys who are rich but stupid. they wind up with these over made up over dressed up. Women with the big boobs or the boobs.

113
00:18:44,009  -->  00:18:53,249
They're just shoved in your face guy who are just like pathetic, right? I mean, those kinds of girls like trashy girls, right? Those guys who drive the Lamborghini wind up with the trashy girls.

114
00:18:53,669  -->  00:19:06,269
Yeah. Because the higher quality girls, right, the more decent girls. The brain year smarter girls. Yeah. They see a guy with the flashy car and they don't buy his brand bullshit.

115
00:19:06,449  -->  00:19:13,350
Yeah, because they know. They know that all he's got is money. But that's it. Same with the brainy stuff. See, guy who's really brainy.

116
00:19:13,380  -->  00:19:22,350
Presumably you for instance, you're really fucking brainy. And you show off how fucking smart you are. This works with the brain girls who don't give a shit about anything else.

117
00:19:22,410  -->  00:19:30,750
Right? The the nerdy girls the girls with glasses, right? They care about a really smart guy. But they are not necessarily the hottest girl.

118
00:19:31,650  -->  00:19:41,670
You see, there are different kinds of girls will pay attention to different shit tests. And the other girls will ignore that guy.

119
00:19:42,060  -->  00:19:50,280
See? The really hot, dressed up girl, you know the model, for instance? She's not going to pay attention to the brainy guy.

120
00:19:50,580  -->  00:19:59,070
Okay, because she's gonna say correctly, that the brainy guy all he's got is brains, but he doesn't have money and he doesn't have social position.

121
00:19:59,160  -->  00:20:06,150
Fuck them. Yeah, yeah, that's how it works, what you want to be as an all rounder, you want to be an all rounder in the sense of,

122
00:20:06,180  -->  00:20:17,010
you know, being able to show a little bit of money, a little bit of brains a little bit of social position. And the fact that you've dated somebody of a woman of a higher status than the girl,

123
00:20:17,010  -->  00:20:31,140
you're after you want all four. Because if you focus on just one, you're going to get, essentially a distorted woman, a woman who prioritizes just one thing over the others.

124
00:20:31,410  -->  00:20:41,730
You see what I'm saying? Just like the guy who shows off the flashy car, and he's going to attract the bimbo. Right? who only cares about money,

125
00:20:41,730  -->  00:20:50,970
the gold digger who only cares about money. Yeah, and just as the brainy guy who shows off how smart he is, he's gonna attract the nerdy girl who is not particularly attractive,

126
00:20:51,270  -->  00:21:02,310
you know? The same, you see what I'm saying here, you're gonna attract a very narrow kind of girl, if you're only good with one kind of shit test.

127
00:21:02,460  -->  00:21:09,870
That's why you have to be good at all the shit tests, you know, see, I'm saying, once again, I'm sort of like not explaining what the fuck I'm trying to say.

128
00:21:09,900  -->  00:21:17,130
And I have notes and everything, you know, I, I try to think of this shit and prepare for the shin. You know, I start talking,

129
00:21:17,130  -->  00:21:22,740
I sound like a fucking retard, or the ideas I wrote down seemed, you know, better than they actually were word of the photo,

130
00:21:22,740  -->  00:21:32,250
you know, I'm just complaining. But anyway, the point I'm trying to make here is that see, you got to be an all around. And the only way to get good at chatez is to go out there,

131
00:21:32,430  -->  00:21:40,440
interact with a lot of women, and figure out what their priorities are. Okay? If that's the key ish, you figure out what their priority is,

132
00:21:40,680  -->  00:21:50,340
and they're going to test you on that thing. The gold digger is going to shit test you on how much money you have. The Brainiac girl is gonna you know should test you on how smart you are,

133
00:21:50,340  -->  00:21:59,070
how many books you've read shit like that. You know, the the social butterfly girl, she's gonna shit test you, in so far as you know,

134
00:21:59,130  -->  00:22:06,930
the social position and what parties you go to and shit like that. Right? And, and the girl who's competing with the other girls,

135
00:22:07,020  -->  00:22:18,210
she's going to shoot test you and try to figure out what quality of woman you are seeing is, each of them has a priority. And that's when you got to pay attention to what's the priority of the girl.

136
00:22:18,870  -->  00:22:28,770
That priority is the thing that she's going to test you on. And she's going to shit test you multiple times until she gets undeniable proof that you have that thing,

137
00:22:28,980  -->  00:22:36,750
okay. I mean, like, put into simple terms like, you know, insofar as a brainy girl, right? She wants to make sure that you're smart.

138
00:22:36,750  -->  00:22:47,370
And she'll have like brain teasers or ask you about obscure authors or shit like that, right? Something that you know, a dumbbell with a lot of money who's driving a Lamborghini,

139
00:22:47,370  -->  00:22:53,700
you know, he's gonna blow her off. He's not gonna know what the fuck she's talking about. You know it, she'll mention, you know,

140
00:22:53,700  -->  00:23:01,800
Richard Fineman or son, I, then he'll be like, Huh, you know, and instantly, he fucked up the shit test that she gave him. But you know,

141
00:23:02,250  -->  00:23:11,490
she'll do that relentlessly. Until she's absolutely sure. That's how it works. These shit tests, they don't go away. And they're constant.

142
00:23:12,120  -->  00:23:18,870
And you got to be prepared. You got to be prepared. And you got to recognize too, that it's not personal. She's not trying to shit on you.

143
00:23:19,320  -->  00:23:31,560
She's not trying to be nasty to you. On the contrary, a girl will only give a shit test to a guy that she is seriously considering.

144
00:23:32,250  -->  00:23:41,040
She won't waste her time with the guy that she does not take seriously. Yeah, I should test when you start getting shit tests from the girl.

145
00:23:41,220  -->  00:23:52,260
It means that you're on track with the girl. Okay? And that's why you have to prepare this shit. Don't think that you can just laugh it off some shit tests these shit tests.

146
00:23:52,260  -->  00:24:01,290
They're very, very serious. Because see, a girl will never really want you until you have passed the shit tests that she puts on you.

147
00:24:01,530  -->  00:24:10,770
Okay, so understand how crucial they are. But don't freak out about it. The way you have to handle them is with humor. Yeah,

148
00:24:10,770  -->  00:24:21,300
humor always wins and shit tests. Absolutely. You make a joke about the shit test. If because if you're really confident in whatever it is the quality that she's testing you for.

149
00:24:21,690  -->  00:24:30,750
If you're really confident that quality and you laugh it off laugh offer shit test or do the the the the meta thing of like,

150
00:24:30,780  -->  00:24:36,510
sort of like taking a step back and saying outright Oh, you're shit testing me on this thing? Okay, let's try it. Let's go,

151
00:24:36,780  -->  00:24:48,900
you know, and making a joke about it. That will earn you even more points. Because if you For instance, if you are talking with a brainy girl,

152
00:24:49,740  -->  00:24:58,560
and she starts asking you about Albert Einstein and Richard Fineman and quantum mechanics or some shit like that, and you openly say Oh,

153
00:24:58,560  -->  00:25:05,880
so you want to shit test To me and figure out if I'm a dumbbell or not okay, I can play this game. Let's talk about Richard Fineman or whatever the fuck,

154
00:25:05,880  -->  00:25:15,180
right? If you play it like that, instantly she will know that you passed it. Basically you do that move and you pass the shit test.

155
00:25:15,300  -->  00:25:25,740
Okay? Did it with the money thing, okay? girl says to us Oh, so what car do you drive us to? Oh, you want to? You want to see if I'm up to stuff that I'll drive you inside.

156
00:25:25,740  -->  00:25:33,690
Okay, I can play that game. But of course, the thing is here, when you do that with the money situation, for instance, you better be driving a fucking good car.

157
00:25:34,290  -->  00:25:49,410
Yeah. And ditto with the, the social proof. The one where we're, uh, you're in a good social company. See, you better know the people that she knows or know the people that she knows or know that people that she wants to know.

158
00:25:49,620  -->  00:25:59,100
Okay? I mean, you see, it's, it's a dangerous game. You can only do it. You can only pull off this shit. When you're really sure of yourself and you really have the goods.
